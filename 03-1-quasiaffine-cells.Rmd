# Quasi-Affine Cells { #sec:quasi-affine }

In this section, we develop an algorithm, based on @bgv15, Theorem 3.19, for constructing a CAD whose $2$, $1$, and
$0$-dimensional cells are the graphs of quasi-affine maps. This is the first step to constructing a monotone cylindrical decomposition, as described in @bgv15, Theorem 3.20.

::: {.proposition #bgv-quasi }
[@bgv15, Theorem 3.19]

Let $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ be bounded deﬁnable subsets in $\R^n$ with $\dim (V_i) \le 2$ for each
$1 \le i \le k$.
Then there is a cylindrical cell decomposition of $\R^n$, compatible with each $V_i$, such that every cylindrical cell contained in $V := V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map.

The following will be proved.

::: { .theorem #bgv-quasi-algorithm }
Let
$F_1,\ldots,F_k$
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas containing $s$ different polynomials $\mathbf{F} = \{ f_1,\ldots, f_s \} \subset
\Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, having maximum degree $d$, such that $F_i, 1\le i \le k$ defines a bounded semialgebraic set $V_i
\subset \R^n$ of dimension at most $2$.

Then there is an algorithm, taking $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ as input, which constructs an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD
$\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^n$ such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ is a smooth manifold and the graph of a
quasi-affine map.
In particular, $\mathcal{D}$ is compatible with each $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.
This algorithm has complexity
$$
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{2^{\O(n)}},
$$
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

## The $2$-dimensional locus

The proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.19 begins by introducing $W$, the smooth $2$-dimensional locus of $V = V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$.
Since $V$ is a semialgebraic set, it can be represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula $F$.
$W$ can be computed using the smooth stratification algorithm described in Section \@ref(sec:smooth-strat).
In order to apply the algorithm, consider the sign sets $S_{(\ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s)} \subset \R^n$ of polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ appearing in the formula $F$, as described in Section \@ref(sec:strat-semialgebraic). Observe that a finite number of these sign-sets $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ form a partition of $V$.
For each $S_i \subset V$, apply the smooth stratification algorithm to obtain a family $(X_{i,1}, \ldots X_{i,n})$ of strata, where each $X_{i,j}$ is a smooth subset of $S_i$ of codimension $j$.
We have $\dim(S_i) \le 2$, since each of the sets in the union $V$ has dimension at most $2$. Hence, every stratum $X_{i,j}$ of codimension $j < n-2$ will be empty.
We obtain the smooth $2$-dimensional locus of $V$ by taking the union of strata of codimension $n-2$. For each stratum,
it is important to keep the set of $n-2$ polynomials defining it, as these will be needed in the next step. We will need
the strata of codimension $n-1$, as each $1$-dimensional cell must also be the graph of a quasi-affine map.

### An alternative approach

Recall from Section \@ref(sec:cad-construction) that smooth cells can be guaranteed by choosing a certain projection operator.
More precisely, according to @mccallum1998, Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, if there is a finite number of blow-up points
(i.e., if the set of input polynomials is well-oriented), then the McCallum
projection operator is guaranteed not to fail and will result in a CAD
where all cells are analytic submanifolds.
Since $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ for all $1 \le i \le k$, blow-up points in $\cl(V_i)$ have dimension at most $0$ and the set of
input polynomials is well-oriented (see the Remark after Definition \@ref(def:blow-up-point)).
Hence, the McCallum projection operator is sufficient to produce smooth cells.
Note that the McCallum projection operator can fail if the set of input polynomials is not well oriented. In this case,
the Lazard projection operator can be substituted, and will also produce smooth cells [@mccallum2019].

Let $\mathbf{F} \subset \R^n$ be the set of different polynomials appearing in the quantifier-free Boolean formulas defining $V$ and use the McCallum projection operator to construct an $F$-invariant CAD, $\cal E$, of $\R^n$. Since cells of a CAD are disjoint by construction and smooth by the use of the McCallum projection operator, $\cal E$ forms a smooth stratification of $V$.
Thus, we can take as $W$ the (separate) sets of $2$- and $1$-dimensional cells of $\cal E$ which are contained in $V$.
Recall, from Definition \@ref(def:cells), that each cylindrical cell has a corresponding binary index $(i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$.
Let $C \subset V$ be a $2$-dimensional cell of $\mathcal{E}$, and suppose it has binary index $(i_1,\ldots,i_n)$.
Since $\dim(C) = 2$, $i_1 + \cdots + i_n = 2$. Let $i_{j_1}, = i_{j_2} = 1$ for $j_1 \ne j_2$ while all other elements
of the binary index be equal to zero. Then $\projop{k}(C)$, for $k\ne j_1,k\ne j_2$, is the root of a projection polynomial $f_k \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k]$. Hence, we have, $n-2$ projection polynomials at which every $\mathbf{x} \in C$ is equal to zero.
The polynomials can be determined by using the set of signs of projection factors and used to define an algebraic variety $Y \supset C$. Note that we need some additional inequalities to define $C$ properly, but these are not needed to compute the critical points of projections in the next section.
Similarly for $1$-dimensional cells, only one element of the binary index will be equal to $1$, while all other elements are
equal to $0$. It follows that we can find $n-1$ polynomials, in a similar way, which are equal to zero on each $1$-dimensional cell.

It is possible to compute $W$ using either technique. Theoretically speaking, using the smooth stratification algorithm seems cleaner, as it is the correct tool for the job. In addition, the bound on number of strata is singly exponential, while the bound on number of CAD cells is doubly exponential. An estimate for the number of cells of strata having a certain dimension is not currently known, but it seems likely that the number of strata will be less than the number of CAD cells.
@gv04, Theorem 3.7 gives a method (which can be turned into an algorithm) for efficiently listing all sign sets associated with a set of polynomials and @bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21 describes how quantifier elimination can be performed in singly exponential time.
However, in the implementation
CAD is used to perform the emptiness check. Thus, the second option seems more appealing because a single recomputation of the CAD is preferable to many calls to the CAD algorithm, which would be required for the stratification-based approach in the form that it has been implemented.
In addition, @kremer2020 propose an algorithm, along with its implementation, for refining a CAD to be compatible with new polynomials. This gives us hope that we may be able to avoid a full re-computation. In conclusion, the second option, where we compute an initial CAD consisting of smooth cells, is more tractable in practice.

## Cells as graphs of quasi-affine maps

We now discuss how to obtain quasi-affine cells. A $k$-dimensional cell $C$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map if, for each affine coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^n$, the image of the projection map $\proj_{L}(C)$ is $k$-dimensional if and only if the map $\proj_{L}\vert_C$ is injective (see Definition \@ref(def:quasi-affine)).
In order to satisfy this property, @bgv15, Lemma 3.19 states that the CAD $\cal D$ also needs to be compatible with the
critical points, $W_{i}$ and $W_{i,j}$, of projections of $W$ onto one and $2$-dimensional coordinate subspaces $\opspan{x_i,x_j}$ and $\opspan{x_i}$.

Let $W'_k$ be one of the strata (or smooth cylindrical cells) computed in the previous section, with $k\in \{1,2\}$. Since $W'_k$ has codimension $n-k$ and is a basic semialgebraic set, its formula contains $n-k$ polynomial equations and, possibly, some inequalities.
Consider the Jacobi matrix
$$
J_{\hat{w}}:=\begin{pmatrix}\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{i_{\ell}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\partial f_{n-k}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial f_{n-k}/\partial x_{i_{\ell}}
\end{pmatrix},
$$
where $\{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell\} \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}$.
Let $w := \{j_1,\ldots,j_{n-\ell}\}$ be the complement $\{ 1 , \ldots, n \} \setminus \{ i_1,\ldots,i_\ell \}$
so that $\hat{w}$ denotes the complement $\{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell\} = \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus w$.
Regular points of the projection of $W_k'$ onto $\opspan{w}$ are those at which the matrix $J_{w}$ has full rank.
Thus, we can compute the critical points $W'_{i,j}$ of $\projops{x_i,x_j}$ by finding the points at which the Jacobi matrix $J_{\hat{ij}}$ does not have full rank.

Note that, for $W'_{i,j}$, the corresponding $J_{\hat{ij}}$ will be a $((n-2) \times (n-2))$-matrix, so we simply need to find the points at which $\det(J_{\hat{ij}}) = 0$.
On the other hand, $J_{\hat{i}}$ will be an $((n-2) \times (n-1))$-matrix. It will fail to have
full rank if the determinants of all of the $((n-2) \times (n-2))$-minors are zero. Observe that the minors of
$J_{\hat{i}}, i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ are the $((n-2)\times (n-2))$-Jacobi matrices
$J_{\hat{ij}}, j \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}$. I.e., they will coincide with the square matrices associated with $W'_{i,j}$.
Thus, the CAD should have constant sign on each of the determinants
$$
\det(J_{\hat{ij}}) \text{ for all } 1 \le i < j \le n,
$$
for all $2$-dimensional smooth strata (or cells) of $V$, whose definition includes $n-2$ polynomial equations.

Now consider the critical points $Z$ of $\projops{x_i,x_j}(W'_1)$, where $W'_1$ is a smooth $1$-dimensional stratum. If
$\dim(Z) = 1$, then every point of $\projops{x_i,x_j}(W'_1)$ is critical as $W'_1$ is smooth. Note that $Z$ may contain
isolated critical points of $\projops{x_i}$ and $\projops{x_j}$.
Otherwise, $\dim(Z) = 0$, so $Z$ is a collection of isolated points $(c_i,c_j)$. $c_i$ is also a critical point of
$\projops{x_i}(W'_1)$ and $c_j$ is also a critical point of $\projops{x_j}(W'_1)$. Therefore, it is sufficient to
consider only critical points of projections onto $1$-dimensional coordinate subspaces. Hence, we only consider Jacobi matrices
$J_{\hat{i}}$ for all $1\le i \le n$, for the $n-1$ polynomials defining $W'_1$. Critical points are those at which their determinants are equal to zero.

## Correctness and complexity

Correctness of Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm) follows from the proof of @bgv15, Lemma 3.19. Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the CAD computed by the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:quasiaffine-algorithm), using the McCallum projection operator, in which each cell has constant sign on the polynomials defining sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.
By @mccallum1998, Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, each cell $C \subset V$ of $\cal E$ will be an analytic submanifold, since $\dim(V_i) \le 2, 1\le i \le k$.
The algorithm then makes the CAD compatible with the determinants of matrices $J_{C_2,\hat{ij}}$ and
$J_{C_1,\hat{i}}$, defined in Equations \@ref(eq:jacobi-two) and \@ref(eq:jacobi-one) respectively. These are the
critical points of projections of $2$- and $1$- dimensional smooth cylindrical cells $C \subset V_1,\ldots,V_k$. Thus,
$\mathcal{D}$, the CAD output by the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:quasiaffine-algorithm) is compatible with the
critical points of projections of the smooth $2$-dimensional locus of $V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k$ onto one- and $2$-dimensional coordinate subspaces, as required in the proof of @bgv15, Lemma 3.19.

### Complexity { #sec:quasi-complexity }

Let us examine the complexity by supposing that the smooth stratification algorithm is used to find the smooth $2$-dimensional locus of $V = V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k \subset \R^n$, defined by $s$ polynomials having maximum degree $d$.
By the result from Section \@ref(sec:strat-complexity), the smooth stratification step with emptiness checking has complexity
$$
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{\O(n)^{2}}.
$$
The critical points of $1$- and $2$- dimensional strata are then computed. This is done by computing determinants of $(n-1)$- and $(n-2)$-dimensional
Jacobi matrices, containing the $n-1$ and $n-2$ polynomial equations which define the strata of codimension $1$ and $2$ respectively.
These polynomials have maximum degree $(d + 1)^{2}$.
In order to estimate the maximum degree of polynomials appearing in the Jacobi determinant of a $(k \times k)$-matrix,
suppose that elementary row operations -- swapping two rows, multiplying a row by a number and adding one row to another
-- will be used to convert the matrix into row echelon form.
Then the determinant can be computed by multiplying the elements on the main diagonal of the row echelon matrix
together.
Note that the complexity of performing these row operations to transform the matrix into row echelon form is
$\O\left(n^2\right)$.
Elementary row operationns do not change the upper bound on degree. For the determinant, multiplying $k$ polynomials of maximum degree $d$ will result in a polynomial of maximum degree $kd$. Thus, the maximum degree of the determinant of the $((n-2)\times (n-2))$-matrix will be $(n-2)(d + 1)^{2}$ and the $((n-1) \times (n-1))$-matrix will be $(n-1)(d + 1)^{2}$. These are both bounded from above by
$$
n (d + 1)^{2}.
$$

For the critical points of $\projops{x_i}, 1 \le i \le n$, there will be $n$ Jacobi determinants, and for $\projops{x_i,x_j}, 1 \le i < j \le n$, there will be $(n-1) + (n-2) + \cdots + 1 = \tfrac{1}{2} (n-1)n$, which is asymptotically the same as $n^2$.
According to Section \@ref(sec:strat-complexity), the smooth stratification algorithm will produce at most $s^n (d+1)^2$. The bound on the number of strata of each codimension is not known, but the total number of strata is, of course, an upper bound. Therefore, there will be at most $n \left(s^n (d+1)^2\right)$ additional polynomials.

A classical CAD, having constant sign on the $s$ input polynomials along with the $n \left(s^n (d+1)^2\right)$ Jacobi determinants, which have maximum degree $n(d + 1)^{2}$, is then constructed.
According to Proposition \@ref(prp:collins) (@bpr2006, Algorithm 11.2), classical CAD has complexity
$$
\left(s'd'\right)^{\O(1)^{n}},
$$
where $s'$ is the number of input polynomials and $d'$ their maximum degree.
Using the bounds obtained from the application of smooth stratification, we get
$$
\left(\left(s+n\left(s^{n}(d+1)^{2}\right)\right)n\left(d+1\right)^{2}\right)^{\O(1)^{n}},
$$
which can be simplified to
$$
\left(n s^n \left(d+1\right)\right)^{\O(1)^n}.
$$
Since the expression $n^{\O(1)^{n}}$ can be simplified to $2^{\O(1)^{n}}$ we get an upper complexity bound, for constructing a quasi-affine CAD, of
$$
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{\O(1)^{n}}.
$$
By Proposition \@ref(prp:collins), this is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials defining the CAD and their maximum degree.

Adding the stratification step, we get a total complexity of
$$
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{\O(n)^{2}}
+ \left(s(d+1)\right)^{\O(1)^{n}},
$$
which is bounded from above by the doubly exponential CAD computation, leading to a complexity upper bound of
$$
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{\O(1)^{n}}.
$$
