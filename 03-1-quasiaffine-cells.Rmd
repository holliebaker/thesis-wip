# Quasi-affine cells { #sec:quasi-affine }

In this section, we develop an algorithm, based on @bgv15, Theorem 3.18, for constructing a CAD whose two-, one-, and zero-dimensional cells are the graphs of quasi-affine maps.

::: {.proposition #bgv-quase }
[@bgv15, Theorem 3.19]

Let $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ be bounded deﬁnable subsets in $\R^n$ with $\dim (V_i) \le 2$ for each
$ 1 \le i \le k$.
Then there is a cylindrical cell decomposition of $\R^n$, compatible with every $V_i$ such that every cylindrical cell contained in $V := V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map.

The following will be proved.

::: { .theorem #bgv-quasi-algorithm }
Let
$$
F_1,\ldots,F_k
$$
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas containing $s$ different polynomials $\mathbf{F} = \{ f_1,\ldots, f_s \} \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, having maximum degree $d$, such that $F_i, 1\le i \le k$ defines a bounded semialgebraic set $V_i \subset \R^n$ such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$.

Then there is an algorithm, taking $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ as input, which constructs an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^n$, which is obviously compatible with each $V_1,\ldots,v_k$, such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup,\ldots\cup V_k$ is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.
This algorithm has complexity
$$
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{2^{O(n)}},

which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

## Computing the smooth two-dimensional locus of $V$

The proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.19 begins by introducing $W$, the smooth $2$-dimensional locus of $V = V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$.
Since $V$ is a semialgebraic set, it can be represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula $F$.
$W$ can be computed using the smooth stratification algorithm described in @\ref(sec:smooth-strat).
In order to apply the algorithm, consider the sign sets $S_{(\ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s)} \subset \R^n$ of polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ appearing in the formula $F$, as described in Section \@ref(sec:strat-semialgebraic). Observe that a finite number of these sign-sets $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ form a partition of $V$.
For each $S_i \subset V$, apply the smooth stratification algorithm to obtain a family $(X_{i,1}, \ldots X_{i,n})$ of strata, where each $X_{i,j}$ is a smooth subset of $S_i$ of codimension $j$.
We have $\dim(S_i) \le 2$, since each of the sets in the union $V$ has dimension at most 2. Hence, every stratum $X_{i,j}$ of codimension $j < n-2$ will be empty.
We obtain the smooth two-dimensional locus of $V$ by taking the union of strata of codimension $n-2$. For each of stratum, it is important to keep the set of $n-2$ polynomials defining it, as these will be needed in the next step. We will need the strata of codimension $n-1$, as each one-dimensional cell must also be the graph of a quasi-affine map.

### An alternative method for computing the smooth two-dimensional locus

Recall from Section \@ref(sec:cad-construction)) that smooth cells can be guaranteed by choosing a certain projection operator.
More precisely, according to @mccallum1988, Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, if there is a finite number of blow-up points, then the McCallum projection operator will result in a CAD where all cells are analytic submanifolds.
Since $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ for all $1 \le i \le k$, we may assume that blow-up points will have dimension at most $0$. Hence, the McCallum projection operator will result in smooth cells being produced. Since each input set $V_i$ has dimension at most two, $\cl(V_1)$ will only contain zero-dimensional blow-up points.

Let $\mathbf{F} \subset \R^n$ be the set of polynomials appearing in the quantifier-free Boolean formulas defining $V$ and use the McCallum projection operator to construct an $F$-invariant CAD, $\cal E$, of $\R^n$. Since cells of a CAD are disjoint by construction and smooth by the use of the McCallum projection operator, $\cal E$ forms a smooth stratification of $V$.
Thus, we can take as $W$ the (separate) sets of $2$- and $1$-dimensional cells of $\cal E$ which are contained in $V$.
Let $C$ be one of these cells, and suppose it has index $(i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$. Since $\dim(C) = 2$, $\sum_{1\le i \le n} = 2$. Let $i_{j_1}, = i_{j_2} = 1$ for $j_1 \ne j_2$ and all other elements of the index be equal to zero. Then $\projop{k}(C)$, for $k\ne j_1,k\ne j_2$, is the root of a projection polynomial $f_k \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k]$. Hence, we have, $n-2$ projection polynomials at which every $\mathbf{x} \in C$ is equal to zero.
The polynomials can be determined by using the set of signs of projection factors and used to define an algebraic variety $V \supset C$. Note that we need some additional inequalities to define $C$ properly, but these are not needed to compute the critical points of projections in the next section.
Similarly for $1$-dimensional cells, only one element of the index will be equal to $1$, while all other elements are equal to $0$. It follows that we can find $n-1$ polynomials, in a similar way, which are equal to zero on each one-dimensional cell.

It is possible to compute $W$ using either technique. Theoretically speaking, using the smooth stratification algorithm seems cleaner, as it is the correct tool for decomposing a set into smooth manifolds. @gv04, Theorem 3.7 gives a method (which can be turned into an algorithm) for efficiently listing all these sign sets and @bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21 describes how quantifier elimination can be performed in singly exponential time.
However, in the implementation
<!-- TODO (see implementation and testing section) -->
CAD is used to perform the emptiness check. Thus, the second option seems more appealing because a single recomputation of the CAD is preferrable to many calls to the CAD algorithm, which would be required for the tratification-based approach.
In addition, @kremer2020 propose an algorithm, along with its implementation, for refining a CAD to be compatible with new polynomials. This gives us hope that we may be able to avoid a full re-computation. In conclusion, the second option, where we compute an initial CAD consisting of smooth cells, is more tractable in practice.

## Ensuring that every cell is the graph of a quasi-affine map

We now discuss how to obtain quasi-affine cells. A cell $C$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map if, for each affine coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^n$, the restriction of the projection map $\proj_{L}\vert_C$ if and only if the image under this map is $n$-dimensional (see Definition \@ref(def:quasi-affine)).
In order to satisfy this property, @bgv15, Lemma 3.19 states that the CAD $\cal D$ also needs to be compatible with the critical points, $W_{i}$ and $W_{i,j}$, of projections of $W$ onto one and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces $\opspan{x_i,x_j}$ and $\opspan{x_i}$.

Let $W'_k$ be one of the strata computed in the previous section, with $k\in \{1,2\}$. Since $W'_k$ has codimension $n-k$ and is a basic semialgebraic set, its formula contains $n-k$ polynomial equations and, possibly, some inequalities.
Consider the Jacobi matrix
$$
J_{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell}:=\begin{pmatrix}\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{i_{\ell}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\partial f_{k}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial f_{n-k}/\partial x_{i_{\ell}}
\end{pmatrix},
$$
where $\{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell\} \subset \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$. Let $\{j_1,\ldots,j_{n-\ell}\} = \{ 1 , \ldots, n \} \setminus \{ i_1,\ldots,i_\ell \}$.
Regular points of the projection of $W'$ onto $\opspan{j_1,\ldots,j_{n - \ell}}$ are those at which the matrix $J_{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell}$ has full rank.
Thus, we can compute the critical points $W'_{i,j}$ of $\projops{x_i,x_j}$ by finding the points at which the Jacobi matrix $J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}$ does not have full rank.

Note that, for $W'_{i,j}$, the corresponding $J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}$ will be a $((n-2) \times (n-2))$-matrix, so we simply need to find the points at which $\det(J_{\{1\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}) = 0$.
On the other hand, $J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}}$ will be an $((n-2) \times (n-1))$-matrix. It will fail to have full rank if the determinants of all of the $((n-2) \times (n-2))$ minors is zero. Observe that the minors of $J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}}, i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ are the $((n-2)\times (n-2))$-jacobi matrices $J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}, j \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}$. I.e., they will coincide with the square matrices associated with $W'_{i,j}$. Thus, we need to make the CAD have constant sign on
$$
J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}} \text{ for all } i \ne j,
$$
for all two-dimensional smooth strata (or cells) of $V$, whose definition includes $n-2$ polynomial equations.

Now consider the critical points $Z$ of $\projops{x_i,x_j}(W'_1)$, where $W'_1$ is a smooth one-dimensional stratum. If $\dim(Z) = 1$, then every point of $\projops{x_i,x_j}(W'_1)$ is critical as $W'_1$ is smooth. Note that $z$ may contain zero-dimensional critical points of $\projops{x_i}$ and $\projops{x_j}$.
Otherwise, $\dim(Z) = 0$, so $Z$ is a collection of isolated points $(c_i,c_j)$. $c_i$ is also a critical point of $\projops{x_i}(W'_1)$ and $c_j$ is also a critical point of $\projops{x_j}(W'_1)$. Therefore, it is sufficient to consider only critical points of projections onto one-dimensional coordinate subspaces. Hence, we only -consider Jacobi matrices
$J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}}$ for all $1\le i \le n$, for the $n-1$ polynomials defining $W'_1$. Critical points exist when their determinants are equal to zero.

## Correctness and Complexity

Correctness of Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm) follows from the proof of @bgv15, Lemma 3.19. Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the CAD computed by the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:quasiaffine-algorithm), using the McCallum projection operator, in which each cell has constant sign on the polynomials defining sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.
By @mccallum1988, Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, each cell $C \subset V$ of $\cal E$ will be an analytic submanifold, since $\dim(V_i) \le 2, 1\le i \le k$.
The algorithm then makes the CAD compatible with the determinants of matrices $J_{C_2,\mathbf{m}}$ and $J_{C_1,\mathbf{m}}$, defined in Equations \@(ref:eq-jacobi-two) and \@ref(eq:jacobi-one) respectively. These are the critical points of projections of two- and one- dimensional smooth cylindrical cells $C \subset V_1,\ldots,V_k$. Thus, $\mathcal{D}$, the CAD output by the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:quasiaffine-algorithm) is compatible with the critical points of projections of the smooth two-dimensional locus of $V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k$ onte one- and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces, as required in the proof of @bgv15, Lemma 3.19.

### Complexity Analysis { #sec:quasi-complexity }

Let us examine the complexity by supposing that the smooth stratification algorithm is used to find the smooth two-dimensional locus of $V = V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k \subset \R^n$, defined by $s$ polynomials having maximum degree $d$.
By the result from Section \@ref(sec:strat-complexity), the smooth stratification step with emptiness checking has complexity
$$
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{2^{O(n)}}.
$$
The critical points of one- and two- dimensional strata are then computed. This is done by computing determinants of $(n-1)$- and $(n-2)$-dimensional Jacobi matrices, containing the $n-1$ and $n-2$ polynomial equations which define the strata of codimension $1$ and $2$ respectively.
These polynomials have maximum degree $(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}$.
In order to estimate the maximum degree of polynomials appearing in the Jacobi determinant of a $(k \times k)$-matrix, suppose that elementary row operations -- swapping two rows, multiplying a row by a number and adding one row to another -- will be used to convert the matrix into upper triangular form, then the elements on the main diagonal will be multiplied.
Elementary row operationns do not change the upper bound on degree. For the determinant, multiplying $k$ polynomials of maximum degree $d$ will result in a polynomial of maximum degree $kd$. Thus, the maximum degree of the determinant of the $((n-2)\times (n-2))$-matrix will be $(n-2)(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}$ and the $((n-1) \times (n-1))$-matrix will be $(n-1)(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}$. These are both asymptotically the same as
$$
n (d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}},
$$
which is asymptotically the same as
$$
(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}.
$$
For the critical points of $\projops{x_i}, 1 \le i \le n$, there will be $n$ Jacobi determinants, and for $\projops{x_i,x_j}, 1 \le i < j \le n$, there will be $(n-1) + (n-2) + \cdots + 1 = \tfrac{1}{2} (n-1)n$, which is asymptotically the same as $n^2$.

A classical CAD, having constant sign on the $s$ input polynomials along with the $n + n^2$ Jacobi determinants, which have maximum degree $(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}$, is then constructed.
According to Proposition \@ref(prp:collins) (@bpr2006, Algorithm 11.2), classical CAD has complexity
$$
\left(s'd'\right)^{O(1)^{n}},
$$
where $s'$ is the number of input polynomials and $d'$ their maximum degree.
Using the bounds obtained from the application of smooth stratification, we get
$$
\left((s + n^2 + n)(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}\right)^{O(1)^n}
= \left(s(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}} + n(d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}} + n^2 (d + 1)^{1^{O(n)}}\right)^{O(1)^n},
$$
which is bounded from above by
$$
\left(s(d + 1)\right)^{2^{O(n)}}.
$$
By Proposition \@ref(prp:collins), this is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials defining the CAD and their maximum degree.

Since this is the same complexity bound as for stratification, the total complexity of constructing a CAD, compatible with all $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ and such that each cell contained in $V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$ is smooth and the graph of a quasi-affine map is
$$
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{2^{O(n)}}.
$$
