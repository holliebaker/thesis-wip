# Quasi-affine cells { #sec:quasi-affine }

Let $$
V := V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k
$$
be a family of semialgebraic sets such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ for $1\le i \le k$.
According to [@bgv15 Theorem 3.20], the first step in constructing a CAD with monotone cells is to construct a CAD $\cal D$ compatible with $V$ such that each cell of $\cal D$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map. We do this following [@bgv15, Lemma 3.19].

## Computing the smooth twe-dimensional locus of $V$

We begin by computing the smooth 2-dimensional locus, $W$, of $V$. This can be done by computing a smooth stratification of $V$ (as described in Section \ref(sec:smooth-strat)). Let
$$
f_1,\ldots,f_s
$$
be the polynomials defining $V$. We use a slightly modified version of the smooth stratification algorithm which will avoid the expensive emptiness check.  Instead of checking whether each set $Y_k$ is empty, we just compute all possible partial differentials $f_M$ for each $M = (i_n,\ldots,i_1,j)$. A CAD which is sign-invariant with respect to $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ and all $f_M$ will be compatible with $V$ and the smooth two-dimensional locus $W$.

Alternatively, recall, from Section \@ref(sec:cad-construction)), thet smooth cells can be guaranteed by choosing a certain projection operator.
More specifically, according to [@mccallum1988 Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4], if there is a finite number of blow-up poits, which will be the case since input sets have dimension at most 2, then smooth cells will be obtained if McCallus's projection operator is used.
Looking towards extend the construction to sets of higher dimension, @mccallum2019 proved that we could use Lazard's projection operator, which does not have the restriction on the dimension of blow-up points.

## Ensuring that every cell is the graph of a quasi-affine map

In order to obtain quasi-affine cells, [@bgv15, Lemma 3.19] states that we need to consider the critical points, $W_{i}$ and $W_{i,j}, of projections of $W$ onto one and two-dimensional coordnate subspaces (indexed by $i$ and $j$) respectively. The classical CAD compatible with $V, W$ and all $W_i$ and $W_{i,j}$, $1 \le i \le j \le n$ will contain quasi-affine cells.

Let $f$ be one of the polynomials in $f_1,\ldots,f_s$. Then the critical points of the projection map onto $\oplpan{x_i}$ can be found by computing the partial derivative and solving
$$
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = 0.
$$
The solutions of $\{ f = 0, \partial f / \partial x_i = 0 \}$ are the local maxima and minima of $f$ along the $x_i$-axis. Similarly, the critical points of the projection map onto the two-dimensional subspace $\opspan{x_i,x_j}$ are given by the solutions to the system
$$
\{ f = 0, \partial f / \partial x_i = 0, \partial f / \partial x_j \}.
$$
Thus, $W_i$, the set of critical points of the projection map $\projops{x_i}$, are given by $\lor_{1 \le k \le s} \{ f_k = 0, \partial f_k / \partial x_i # 0 \}$ and $W_{i,j}$, the set of critical points of $\projops{x_i,x_j}$, is given by $\lor_{1 \le k \le s} \{ f_k = 0, \partial f_k / \partial x_i = 0, \partial f_k / \partial x_j = 0 \}$.
Alternatively, we can compute a CAD which is sign-invariant with respect to the input polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ and all first partial derivatives (with respect to all variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$) of the input polynomials.
Note that these first partial derivatives will have already been added if we applied the smooth stratification algorithm, which computes them for $k=1$, to find $W$.

Since the smooth stratification algorithm has compleity doubly exponential in the number of variables, and this is also a bound on the number of strata (and therefore number of new polynomials to be added), it makes sense to avoid this computation if possible. Therefore, the choice was made to use McCallum's projection operator and compute a CAD sign-invariant with respect to $$f_1,\ldots,f_s$$ (the polynomials appearing in the formula defining $V$) and the first partial derivatives
$$
\partial f_j / \partial x_i
$$
for $1 \le j \le s$ and $1 \le i \le n$.
Denote this CAD by $\cal D$.
