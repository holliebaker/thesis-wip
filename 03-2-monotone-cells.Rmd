# Monotone Cells { #sec:monotone-cells }

So far, we have constructed an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^n$, compatible with a family of bounded
semialgebraic sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ of dimension at most $2$, in which every cell $C\subset V_1\cup \ldots\cup V_k$ is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.
We now return to [@bgv15 Theorem 3.20] and discuss how to obtain monotone cells, starting with this quasi-affine decomposition.

We first present a motivating example, of a $2$-dimensional cylindrical cell which is quasi-affine but not monotone.

::: {.example #monotone-cells}
[@bgv15, Example 3.2]

Let
$$
\Delta := \{ (x,y) \in \R^2 \mid 0 < x < 1, y > 0, x + y < 1 \} \subset \R^2
$$ and
$$
\varphi(x,y) = x^2 + y^2.
$$
Let $Y \subset \R^3$ be the graph of function $\phi$ on $\Delta$. Observe that $Y$ is a cylindrical cell and $\varphi\vert_\Delta$ is a quasi-affine map, since it is strictly increasing in both $x$ and $y$.
However, $y \cap \{ z = 3/4 \}$ is not connected, hence $\phi\vert_\Delta$ is not a monotone function and $Y$ is not a monotone cell.

```

::: {.definition #sub-cad}
Let $\cal D$ be a CAD of $\R^n$ and suppose that $\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_k)$ is a $0$-dimensional section cell in the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^k$.
By [@bgv15 Remark 3.8], the set of all cells of $\cal D$ contained in the affine coordinate subspace
$$
\{ x_1=c_1,\dots,x_k=c_k \}
$$
forms a cylindrical decomposition of $\R^{n-k}$. This decomposition will be called the sub-decomposition of $\cal D$ above $c$, and $\mathbf{c}$ the base cell of the sub-decomposition (or sub-CAD).
:::

The construction of monotone cells is based on the following result due to @bgv15.

::: {.proposition #bgv-monotone}
[@bgv15, Lemma 3.18]

Let $X \subset \R^2$ be an open, bounded set and $f \colon X \to \R$ be a quasi-affine function.
Then there is a cylindrical decomposition of $\R^2$ compatible with $X$, obtained by intersecting $X$ with straight lines $$\{x_1 = c\}$$ and half-planes $$\{x_1 < c\},\{x_1 > c\}$$ such that the restriction $f\vert_B$ for every cell $B \subset X$ is a monotone function.
:::

We now summarise the construction presented by @bgv15 in the proof of Theorem 3.20.
Their proof proceeds by induction on $n$.

- The base case, $n=1$ is straightforward, since $(0)$ and $(1)$-cells are already monotone.

- When $n>1$, consider each $2$-dimensional cell $C$ of $\cal D$ and let $C'' := \projop{1}(C)$

  - If $\dim(C'') = 0$, apply the inductive hypothesis to the sub-decomposition of $\cal D$ above $C''$.
  - Otherwise, $C$ has index $\{1,i_2,\dots,i_n\} \in \{0,1\}^n$. Let $\alpha$ be the smallest among $\{2,\dots,n\}$ such that $i_\alpha = 1$. Since $\dim(C) = 2$, only $i_1$ and $i_\alpha$ are equal to $1$, while all other elements of the index are equal to $0$. By @bgv15, Lemma 3.3, $\projops{x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n}(C)$, for all $i \in \{2,\ldots,\alpha-1,\alpha+1,\ldots,n\}$, is a cylindrical cell and $C$ is the graph of a continuous function from this cell to $\opspan{x_i}$.

    @bgv15, Lemma 3.19, which provides the construction of $\cal D$ in the previous section, gives us a more useful representation of $C$. Let $X := \projops{x_1,x_\alpha}(C)$ be a $2$-dimensional sector cell. $C$ can be viewed as the graph of a quasi-affine map
    $$
    \mathbf{f} = (f_1,\dots,f_{n-2}) \colon X \to \opspan{x_2,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}, x_{\alpha+1},\ldots,x_n}.
    $$
    By [@bgv15, Lemma 3.18], there exists a refinement of the CAD of $\opspan{x_1,x_\alpha}$, obtained by intersecting $X$ with straight lines and half-planes of the kind
    $$
    \{x_1 < c\}, \{x_1 = c\}, \{x_1 > c\}
    $$
    where $c \in \R$, such that $X$ is a union of monotone sector cells $B$ and $f_j\vert_B$ is a monotone function.
    By [@bgv15 Lemma 3.11], refinements of this kind preserve the cylindrical structure of $\cal D$ and do not destroy existing monotone cells.
    In the semialgebraic case, we will see that the refinement points $c$ will always be algebraic numbers, which makes implementation using computer algebra systems possible.

In the following sections, we will apply the construction given in the proof of @bgv15, Theorems 3.20 and 3.18 to
develop an algorithm for finding the set of refinement points in the semialgebraic case, starting with the CAD $\mathcal{D}$ and its set of input polynomials $\mathbf{F} \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. The following will be proved.

::: { .theorem #bgv-monotone-algorithm }
Let
$$
F_1,\ldots,F_k
$$
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas such that $F_i, 1\le i \le k$ defines a bounded semialgebraic set $V_i \subset \R^n$ such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$.
Let $\mathbf{F} = \{f_1,\ldots,f_s\}$ be a set of polynomials in $\Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ of maximum degree $d$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n$ compatible with each $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ and such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.

Then there is an algorithm, taking $\mathcal{D}$ as input, which produces a refinement $\mathcal{D'}$ of $\mathcal{D}$ monotone with respect to each $V_1, \ldots, V_k$.
This algorithm has complexity
$$
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{{\O(1)^n}},
$$
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

## Sector cells {#sec:monotone-sectors}

Let $C$ be an $(i_1,\ldots,i_n)$-cell such that $i_1 = i_\alpha = 1$ and all other elements of the index are equal to $0$.
The proof of Proposition \@ref(prp:bgv-monotone) proceeds in two stages: first, $X \subset \opspan{x_1,x_\alpha}$ is
refined such that each $Y \subset X$ is a monotone $2$-dimensional sector cell.
Consider the intersection $X \cap \{x_1 = c\}$ for all $c\in \R$. This intersection is a finite union of pairwise disjoint intervals. Let ${\cal I} (c)$ be the family of these intervals associated with the point $c$. Define
$$
\gamma := \{ (x_1,x_\alpha) \in \opspan{x_1,x_\alpha} \mid x_\alpha \text{ is an endpoint of an interval in } {\cal I}(x_1) \}.
$$
Although the cell $X$ under consideration is a $2$-dimensional cylindrical cell in $\opspan{x_1,x_\alpha}$, we actually need to refine the $2$-dimensional cylindrical sector cell $C' := \projop{\alpha}(C)$ in the cylindrical decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{\alpha}$. Thus, we need a way to translate between $C'$ and $X$.

:::{.corollary #gamma-top-bottom}
(to Proposition \@ref(prp:delete-zero-index) (@bgv15, Lemma 3.3))

Let $C\subset \R^\alpha$ be a $(1,0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell, $X := \projops{x_1,x_\alpha} (C)$ and $X' := \projop{1}(C)$.
Suppose we have the family ${\cal I}(c), c \in X'$ and $\gamma$ be the set of $1$-dimensional curves associated with $C$.
Then

1. $X$ is a $(1,1)$-cell.

1. The projection map $\projops{x_1,x_\alpha}\vert_C$ is injective.

1. For each $c \in X'$, the family ${\cal I}(c)$ contains a single open interval.

1. $\gamma$ consists of zero, one or two disjoint curve intervals which coincide with the top and bottom of $X$. Furthermore, the connected components of $\gamma$ can be defined as the graphs of continuous definable functions from $X'$ to $\R$, using the functions defining the cell $C$.
:::

Corollary \@ref(cor:gamma-top-bottom) follows from @bgv15, Lemma 3.3 and the property that $C$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map.
A proof is presented below, which explicitly defines the functions which send points in $X'$ to points in each of the connected components of $\gamma$.

::: {.proof}
Property (1) is proved by repeatedly applying the projection defined in Proposition \@ref(prp:delete-zero-index) (@bgv15, Lemma 3.3) to $C$ to obtain $X$. Property (2)
follows immediately from the fact that $X$ is $2$-dimensional and $C$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map.

Since $X$ is a $2$-dimensional sector cell, by definition it is the semialgebraic set $$
\{ (x_1,t) \in \R^2 \mid x_1 \in X', \varphi(x_1) < t < \psi(x_1) \}
$$
where $\varphi,\psi \colon X' \to \R$ are continuous definable functions such that $\varphi(x_1) < \psi(x_1)$ for all $x_1 \in X'$.
Note that $X$ may not be bounded from below (resp. above).
In this case, $\varphi$ (resp. $\psi$) are omitted from the definition of $X$, as in Definition \@ref(def:cells).
It is clear that ${\cal I}(c)$ contains a single open interval $(\varphi(c), \psi(c))$, proving (3).
It follows that $\gamma$, which consists of the endpoints of intervals in ${\cal I}(c)$, consists of $1$-dimensional curve intervals which are the graphs of $\varphi$ and $\psi$ (if they exist).

We now prove (4) by defining $\varphi$ and $\psi$ using the definition of cylindrical cells.
Since $C' := \projop{\alpha - 1}(C)$ is a $(1,\ldots,0,0)$-cell, it is the graph of a continuous definable map
$\mathbf{h} = (h_1,\ldots,h_{\alpha - 2}) \colon X' \to \R^{\alpha - 2}$ and $$
C = \{ (\mathbf{x},t) \mid \mathbf{x} \in C', f(\mathbf{x}) < t < g(\mathbf{x})\}
$$
where $f,g \colon \R^{\alpha - 1} \to \R$ are continuous definable functions such that $f(\mathbf{x}) < g(\mathbf{x})$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in C'$.
Again, if not bounded from below (resp. above), $f$ (resp. $g$) are omitted.

Finally, we write $C$ in terms of $x_1 \in X'$, $f$, $g$ and $\mathbf{h}$, we obtain the functions
\begin{align}
\varphi &\colon C'' \to \R & \psi &:\colon C'' \to \R\\
\varphi(x_1) &= f(x_1,\mathbf{h}(x_1)) & \psi(x_1) &= g(x_1,\mathbf{h}(x_1))
(\#eq:phi-psi)
\end{align}
:::

The refinement is achieved by finding a set of real numbers
$$
(c_1,\ldots,c_t)
$$
such that, for each $1 \le i < t$,
$$
X \cap \{c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1}\}
$$
is a monotone cell. By [@bgv13, Theorem 1.7], this can be achieved by ensuring that
$$
\gamma \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1}\}
$$
contains only monotone curve intervals. [@bgv15 [Theorem 3.18].

Applying Corollary \@ref(cor:gamma-top-bottom) to $C$, we obtain continuous definable functions $\varphi,\psi \colon X' \to \R$ defining the bottom, $X_B$, and top, $X_T$, of $X$ respectively.
Let $$
(c_1,\ldots,c_t)
$$
such that the graphs of $\varphi\vert_{\{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}}$ and $\psi\vert_{\{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}}$ for all $1 \le i < t$ are monotone curve intervals. By @bgv15, Theorem 1.7, $X \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}$ for all $1\le i < t$ is a semi-monotone set [@bgv15, proof of Lemma 3.18].
For the graphs of $\varphi$ and $\psi$ to be monotone curve intervals, we require that $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in or independent of $x_1$. Thus, $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ are the critical points of $\varphi$ and $\psi$.
Note that if $X$ is not bounded from below, then $\varphi$ does not exist and does not have a graph.
In this case, it is clear that no refinement of $X_B$ is required.

### Finding the critical points {#sec:lagrange-refinement}

We now discuss how to find these critical points starting with the polynomials defining cells in $\cal D$.

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a CAD of $\R^n$ compatible with each set $V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \R^n$ such that every $2$-dimensional cell contained in $V = V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map. Let
\begin{equation}
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_n),
(\#eq:proj-fac-set)
\end{equation}
where ${\cal A}_k \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k], 1 \le k \le n$, be the projection polynomials defining $\cal D$.
I.e., polynomials in $\mathcal{A}_k$ have constant sign on every cell in the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^k$.

Let $C$ be a $(1,0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell of the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{\alpha}$ such that $\projopinv{\alpha}(C)$ is a $2$-dimensional cell of $\mathcal{D}$ contained in $V$.
We now describe how to find the numbers $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ such that $C \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}$ is monotone.

For convenience, we write $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for some $g \in A_k$ and $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$, such that $k < n$, if $g(\projop{k}(\mathbf{x})) = 0$.
Consider the $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-cell
$$
C' := \projop{\alpha - 1}(C)
$$
of the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{\alpha - 1}$.

Observe that
$$
\projop{1}(C) = (a,b) \subset \R
$$
and, since $C'$ is a section cell, there exist polynomials
$$
g_2 \in {\cal A}_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1} \in {\cal A}_{\alpha - 1}
$$ such that $g_i(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $1\le i \le \alpha - 1$ and $\mathbf{x} \in (C')$.
Therefore, there exists a $1$-dimensional algebraic variety
$$
V' := \left\{ g_2(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{\alpha - 1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \right\}
$$
such that $C' \subset V'$.

Now consider the top of $C$, denoted by $C_T$.
By definition, if $C$ is not bounded from above, then $C_T$ does not exist. Otherwise, $C_T$ is the graph of a
continuous definable function $h \colon C' \to \R$.
In the first case, there is nothing to do.
In the second case, $C_T$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^\alpha \mid a < x_1 < b, g_2(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{\alpha - 1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, x_\alpha = h(\mathbf{x}) \},
(\#eq:c-alpha-top)
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}$ is shorthand for $(x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha)$.
By the construction of $\cal D$ (e.g., using Corollary \@ref(cor:mc-smooth)) $C_T$ is $C^\infty$ smooth, therefore $h$ is a differentiable function everywhere in $C'$.

This representation lends itself naturally to the problem of optimisation with constraints -- Lagrange multipliers.

::: {.proposition #lagrange-multipliers}
Let $f \colon \R^n \to \R$ and $g_1,\ldots,g_k \colon \R^n \to \R$ be continuous functions with continuous first partial derivatives.
Local maxima and minima of $f$, subject to the constraints $g_1=0,\ldots,g_k=0$ can be found by computing the critical points of the function
$$
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k) = f(\mathbf{x}) - \lambda_1 g_1(\mathbf{x}) - \cdots - \lambda_k g_k(\mathbf{x}),
$$
where $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$ and $(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k) \in \R^k$ are new variables.

Critical points can be found by solving the system of equations
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} - \lambda_1 \dfrac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_i} - \cdots - \lambda_k \dfrac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_i}= 0,
(\#eq:lagrange)
\end{equation}
where $1\le i \le n-1$,

for $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k$.
:::

::: {.remark #lagrange-solve}
Using variables $(x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha-1})$, constraints $g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1}$ and function $h$ from Equation \@ref(eq:c-alpha-top), the system from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange) can be written in matrix form as follows.
$$
\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\lambda_{\alpha-2}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

It is clear that, if a solution exists, then the last column
$\left(\tfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}},\ldots, \tfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}\right)^T$
will be a linear combination of the first $\alpha - 1$ columns (in $g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1}$).
Hence, optimal values for $(x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha-1})$ exist and satisfy the equation
\begin{equation}
\det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}=0.
(\#eq:jacobi-det)
\end{equation}
:::

Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det) gives a direct formula to solve Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange) for $x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}$. Refinement points $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ are the $x_1$-coordinates of these solutions.

Since $C_T$ is a section cell, there exists a polynomial $g_\alpha \in {\cal A}_\alpha$ such that $$
C_T := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^\alpha \mid \projop{\alpha - 1}(\mathbf{x}) \in C', g_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}.
$$ Thus, there exists an algebraic variety
\begin{equation}
V := \left\{ g_2(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{\alpha-1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \right\}
(\#eq:variety-v)
\end{equation}
such that $C_T \subset V$, where $g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1}$ are the same polynomials appearing in Equation \@ref(eq:c-alpha-top).

Note that $g_\alpha \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha]$ -- it is a multivariate polynomial -- while $h$ from Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det) is expected to be a continuous differentiable function from $\R^{\alpha - 1} \to \R$. In order to use the above construction, we have to be careful only to consider points at which $g_\alpha$ is differentiable.
In other words, we need to compute derivatives of the implicit function $g_\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{d x_\alpha}{d x_i} = \dfrac{\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_i}{\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_\alpha}
(\#eq:total-deriv)
\end{equation}
for $1\le i \le \alpha - 1$.
Let $J_T$ be the determinant of the matrix of partial derivatives from Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det) with each $\partial h / \partial x_i, 1 \le i \le \alpha - 1$ replaced with $d x_\alpha / d x_i$ from Equation \@ref(eq:total-deriv). Observe that the denominator of $\partial h / \partial x_i$, for all $1 \le i \le \alpha - 1$, is equal to
$$d_T := \partial g_\alpha / \partial x_\alpha,$$
so the last column of the matrix, in terms of $g_\alpha$ is actually
$$
\dfrac{1}{d_T} \left( \partial g_{\alpha} / x_1 , \ldots , \partial g_{\alpha} / x_{\alpha - 1}\right)^T.
$$
This results in the determinant
$$
J_T = \frac{1}{d_T} J'_T,
$$
where $J'_T$ is the matrix from Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det) with the $\partial h / \partial x_i$ replaced with $\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_i$ for $1\le i \le \alpha - 1$. I.e.,
\begin{equation}
J'_T = \det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \dfrac{\partial g_\alpha}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \dfrac{\partial g_\alpha}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}=0.
(\#eq:jacobi-det-2)
\end{equation}

Observe that $J_T$ is a rational function: a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are both polynomials. $\mathbf{x} \in \R^{\alpha - 1}$ is a solution of this rational function if and only if $J'_T(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ and $d_T(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0$. Thus, solutions of the system $$
\{ J'_T = 0, d_T \ne 0 \}
$$ should be found.
This is clearly a semialgebraic set.
Also note that, when $\deg(d_T) = 0$, $d_T$ is a constant and therefore has no solutions. Thus, the condition $d_T = 0$ can be dropped in this case.

Repeating this process to obtain $J'_B$ and $d_B$, if sector cell $C$ is bounded from below, we have two systems of polynomial equations
\begin{align}
\{ g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha-1}, J'_B \},\\
\{ g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha-1}, J'_T \}
(\#eq:lagrange-solve)
\end{align}
and inequalities
\begin{equation}
\{ s_1 g_{1,1} > 0, \ldots, s_\ell g_{1,\ell} > 0, d_B \ne 0, d_T \ne 0 \}
(\#eq:lagrange-solve-ineqs)
\end{equation}
where $\{ g_{1,1},\ldots,g_{1,\ell} \} \subset \Z[x_1]$ are polynomials from ${\cal A}_1$ and $s_1,\ldots,s_\ell \in \{-1,1\}$ such that $$
X' = (a,b) = \{ x \in \R \mid s_1 g_{1,1}(x) > 0, \ldots, s_\ell g_{1,\ell}(x) > 0\}.
$$
We can easily find pairs $(s_j, g_{1,j}) \in \{-1,1\} \times {\cal A}_1$ by considering the sign of the sample point $c$ of $X'$ on each polynomial $g_{1,j} \in {\cal A}_1$.

- If $g_{1,j} > 0$, then $s_j = 1$.
- If $g_{1.j}(c) < 0$, then $s_j = -1$.
- The final case, $g_{1,j}(c) = 0$, is impossible since an irreducible univariate polynomial cannot be zero over an interval.

Perhaps an easier way, if the information available, is to examine the signs of polynomials from $\mathcal{A}$ on the cell $X'$. Clearly, if the sign on $g_j$ is positive, $s_i = 1$ and if the sign is negative $s_i = -1$.

For the refinement points $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$, we want to find $x_1$-coordinates of the roots of polynomials from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve) subject to the constraints from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-ineqs).

CAD can, of course, be used to do this, since we are really solving the quantifier elimination problem
$$
\exists x_2,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1},x_\alpha \mid P(x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha)
$$ where
\begin{align}
P(x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha) =\ & s_1 g_{1,1}(x_1) > 0 \land \ldots \land s_\ell g_{1,\ell}(x_1) > 0
(\#eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs) \\
\land\ & g_2(x_1,x_2) = 0 \land \ldots \land g_{\alpha - 1}(x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}) = 0
(\#eq:lagrange-solve-qe-constraints) \\
\land\ & d_B(x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha) \ne 0 \land d_T(x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha) \ne 0
(\#eq:lagrange-solve-qe-denominators) \\
\land\ & ( J'_B(x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}) = 0 \lor J'_T(x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}) = 0 ).
(\#eq:lagrange-solve-qe-jacobis)
\end{align}
Computing the projection onto $\R^1$ of polynomials $\{g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1} J'_B, J'_T \}$ from Equations \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-constraints) and \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-jacobis), a system
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} := \{ f_1=0 ,\ldots,f_r=0 \} \subset \Z[x_1]
(\#eq:lagrange-solve-projected)
\end{equation}
is obtained, whose real roots include the refinement points $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$.
Let ${\cal E} \subset \Z[x_1]$ be the set of polynomials obtained by computing the projection onto $\R^1$ of $\{ d_B, d_T \}$ (from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-denominators)) and
$${\cal G} := \{ s_1 g_{1,1}, \ldots, s_\ell g_{1,\ell} \}
$$
from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs).
$(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ can be found by computing the real roots of $\cal F$ subject to the inequalities $\cal G$, then discarding those such that a polynomial in $\cal E$ is zero.

It is clear that $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ lie in an open interval $X' = (a,b) \subset \R \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \}$, where $a$ and $b$ (if finite) are section cells. Thus, rather than using strict inequalities from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs), we could find the roots of $\cal F$ in the interval $(a,b)$.

Each real root will be represented by a pair
\begin{equation}
c_i := (m_i,J_i)
(\#eq:algebraic-number)

where $c_i$ is the unique root of the polynomial $m_i \in \Z[x_1]$ in the (left-open right-closed) isolating interval $J_i$.
Note that, being solutions of polynomials, every $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ contains only algebraic numbers and roots will appear in ascending order.

Since this procedure follows the construction described in @bgv15, Theorem 3.18, the following has been proved.

::: {.lemma #monotone-sector-algorithm }
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a sign-invariant CAD of $\R^n$ compatible with each set $V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \R^n$ with $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ and such that each cell $C \subset V_i$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map, for $1\le i \le k$. Let
$$
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_n),

where ${\cal A}_k \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k], 1 \le k \le n$, be the projection polynomials defining $\cal D$.
Let $C$ be a $(1,0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell of the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{\alpha}$ such that $\projopinv{\alpha}(C)$ is a cell of $\mathcal{D}$ contained in $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.

Then there is an algorithm, taking $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ as input, which produces a set of algebraic numbers $(c_1,\ldots,c_t)$ such that $C \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}$ is monotone. Each $c_i, 1 \le i < t$ is represented by a pair $(m_i, J_i) \in \Z[x_1] \times \Q$ (see Equation \@ref(eq:algebraic-number).

### Working in sub-decompositions { #sec:sub-cad }

In the previous section, we considered $(1,0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)$-cells
However, we will actually be working in a sub-decomposition $\cal D$ (of $\R^{k+n}$) above a $0$-cell $\mathbf{c}$ of $\R^k$ ($k \ge 0$). Therefore the polynomials appearing in Equation \@ref(eq:variety-v) are elements of $\Z[y_1,\ldots,y_k][x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
From a polynomial $f \in \Z[y_1,\ldots,y_k][x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, a polynomial $g := f(\mathbf{c}) \in \A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
can be obtained by evaluating $f$ at $\mathbf{c}$. Evaluated polynomials $g$ define the sub-CAD of $\R^n$ above $\mathbf{c}$ because $\mathbf{c}$ is a $0$-cell.

Note that, since $\mathbf{c}$ is an algebraic number, $g$ has algebraic coefficients. Since roots of $g$ are algebraic numbers, there exists a polynomial $h \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ if and only if $h(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$. A method for obtaining the polynomial $h$ with integer coefficients is now described.

1. If $f$ is independent of all $y_1,\ldots,y_k$, there is nothing to do, just set $h := f$. Otherwise, $f$ depends on at least one of $y_1,\ldots,y_k$.

1. If $\mathbf{c}$ is rational, then $g = f(\mathbf{c})$ has coefficients in $\Q$. There exists a non-zero $a \in \Z$ such that $h := a g$ has integer coefficients and the same roots as $g$.

1. Otherwise, $\mathbf{c}$ is not rational. Then $f(\mathbf{c})$ has coefficients in $\A$. There exists an algorithm, which takes $g$ as input and returns a polynomial $h \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ if and only if $h(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$.

::: {.remark}
Let $f \in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a polynomial such that
$$
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \dfrac{a_1}{b_1} m_1 + \cdots + \dfrac{a_k}{b_k} m_k
$$
where $m_i = x_1^{d_{i,1}} \cdots x_n^{d_{i,n}}$ for $1 \le i \le k$ is a monomial in $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.

Let $M := \lcm(b_1, \ldots, b_k)$ be the least common multiple of denominators and construct
$$
g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = M f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \dfrac{M a_1}{b_1} m_1 + \cdots + \dfrac{M a_k}{b_k} m_k.
$$
Each coefficient in $g$ will be an integer number since $M$ is divisible by all $b_1,\ldots,b_k$ and polynomials $f$ and $g$ have the same roots.
:::

::: {.definition #norm}
Let $K$ be a field and $L$ a finite (algebraic) extension of $K$.
The field $L$ can be thought of as a finite dimensional vector space over $K$.

Consider $f$ and $m$ be polynomials in $L[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, viewed as polynomials in $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_\alpha]$.
The norm, in $L[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ of $f$ can be found by computing the resultant of $f$ and $m$.
:::

::: {.remark}
Let $f \in \A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a polynomial such that
$$
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = a_1 m_1 + \cdots + a_k m_k
$$
where $m_i = x_1^{d_{i,1}} \cdots x_n^{d_{i,n}}$ is a monomial in variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ and $a_i$ is an element of the algebraic extension of the rational numbers $\Q(\alpha)$ for $1 \le i \le k$.

Let $m \in \Z[\alpha]$ be the minimal polynomial for $\Q(\alpha)$. $f$ can be written as a polynomial in $\Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_\alpha]$ and $m$ can be viewed as a polynomial in $\Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_\alpha]$ which is independent of all $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. Compute
$$
g := \res_\alpha (f,m)
$$
to obtain a polynomial in $\Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. The property that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ if and only if $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ follows from a property of resultants:

> Let $I = \langle f, m \rangle$ be the ideal generated by polynomials $f, m \in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n][\alpha]$, where $K$ is an algebraically closed field.
If at least one of $f$ and $m$ is monic, then
>$$
\res_\alpha (f,m) \in I \cap R.
$$

It follows that $\mathbf{x} \in K^n$ is a common zero of the elements of $I \cap R$ if and only if it is a zero of $\res_\alpha(f,m)$.

## Section cells { #sec:monotone-sections }

Let $X := \projops{x_1,x_\alpha}(C)$ and $(c_1,\ldots,c_r)$ be the refinement points computed in the previous section such that
$$
Y := \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{x+1}\} \cap X,
$$
for some $1 \le i \le r$, is a $2$-dimensional monotone sector cell.
Let us return to [@bgv15, Theorem 3.18] to further refine $Y$ such that every $2$-dimensional section cell is a monotone cell.

The procedure for computing the refinement of $Y$ such that $f_j$ is a monotone function, described in the proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.18, proceeds as follows.
Let $f_j \colon Y \to \opspan{x_j}$ be a component of the quasi-affine map $\mathbf{f} \colon X \to \R$. Since $\mathbf{f}$ is quasi-affine, each component of $\mathbf{f}$ is quasi-affine and the restriction of component $f_j$ to $Y$ is quasi-affine since $Y \subset X$.
Hence, $f_j$ is either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in, or independent of each variable $x_1, x_\alpha$.
In addition, the restriction $f\vert_{Y \cap \{x_\alpha = c\}}$ for any $c \in \R$ is either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in, or independent of $x_\alpha$.
We will compute a refinement of $Y$ such that $f_j\vert_Y$ is monotone, each $B \subset Y$ in the refinement.
As before, only refinements of the kind
$$
\{ x_1 < c \}, \{ x_1 = c \}, \{ x_1 > c \},
$$
$c \in \R$, which preserves both the cylindrical structure and existing monotone cells will be performed.

### Case 1: $2 \le j \le \alpha - 1$

::: {.lemma #one-dim-qa-is-monotone}
Let $Y \subset \R^n$ be the graph of a quasi-affine map
$$
\mathbf{f} \colon (a,b) \to \R^{n-1}
$$
such that $(a,b) \subset \R$. Then $Y$ is a monotone cell.
:::

::: {.proof}
Assume for contradiction that $Y$ is not monotone. Then intersection $Z := Y \cap \{ x_i = c \}$, for some $1\le i \le n$ and $c \in \R$, is not connected.
$Z$ cannot contain an interval, since $Y$ is connected, $1$-dimensional and the graph of a continuous map.
Hence, $Z$ consists of more than one isolated point, which implies that $\projops{i}\vert_Y$ is not injective, but its
image is $1$-dimensional.
This contradicts the assumption that $Y$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map.
:::

Suppose that $2 \le j \le \alpha - 1$.
Since
$$
\projops{x_j,x_\alpha}(C)
$$
is $1$-dimensional, connected and the graph of a quasi-affine map, it follows from Lemma \@ref(lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone) that $\projops{x_j,x_\alpha}(C)$ is a monotone cell and $f_j\vert_Y$ is already a monotone function. No refinement is needed.

### Case 2: $\alpha + 1 \le j \le n$

Now suppose that $\alpha + 1 \le j \le n$.
By [@bgv13, Theorem 3], if functions $$\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j \colon \opspan{x_1} \to \opspan{x_j} \text{ and }
\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j \colon \opspan{x_1} \to \opspan{x_j}$$ are monotone, then $f_j$ itself is monotone.
Hence, we need to find refinement points
$$
\{ b_1,\ldots,b_r \} \subset (c_i,c_{i+1})
$$
such that, for each $1\le \ell < r$, the restrictions of both $\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j$ and $\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j$ to $B := \{ b_\ell < x_1 < b_{\ell + 1} \}$ are monotone.

Consider $$
Z := \projops{x_1,x_j}(C).
$$
If $\dim(Z) < 2$, then it is clear that $\dim(Z) = 1$, because
$$
Y' := \projop{1}(C)
$$ is $1$-dimensional.
It follows that $\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j$ and $\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j$ coincide. Since $Z$ is $1$-dimensional, connected and the graph of a quasi-affine map, Lemma \@ref(lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone) implies that $f_j$ is already monotone and no refinement is needed.

On the other hand, if $\dim(Z) = 2$, since $\mathbf{f}$ is quasi-affine, $\projops{x_1,x_j}\vert_C$ is injective.
Let $Z_T$ be the graph of $\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j$. Despite the notation, $Z_T$ is not necesarily the top of $Z$. In particular, $Z_T$ may have non-empty intersection with $Z$.
Since semialgebraic sets are closed under intersection and projection, there exist points
$$\{b_1,\ldots,b_k\} \subset (c_i,c_{i+1})
$$ such that for all $1 \le i < k$ $$
Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T := Z_T \cap \{ b_i < x_1 < b_{i+1} \}
$$
is either a subset of $Z$ or is disjoint from $Z$.
First suppose that $Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T \subset Z$ for some $1 \le i < k$.
In this case, $Z$ is not bounded from above, so $\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j \vert_{\{ b_i < x_1 < b_{i+1} \}}$ is independent of $x_1$ and is therefore already monotone.
On the other hand, suppose that $Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T \cap Z = \emptyset$.
In this case, $Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T \subset \projops{x_1,x_j}(C_T)$.
If there exists a point $b \in (b_i,b_{i+1})$ such that $\projops{x_1,x_j}(C_T) \cap \{x_1 = b\} \cap Z \neq \emptyset$,
then it is  clear that $C_T \cap \{ b_i < x_1 < b_{i+1} \}$ is not the graph of a continuous function.
I.e., $\projops{x_1,x_\alpha,x_j}(C_T)$ contains an open interval above $(b,y) \in Y_T$.
Since $\dim(C) = 2$, all these blow-up points $(b,y)$ have dimension $0$ and therefore there is a finite number of them. Repeating this process for $\alpha + 1 \le j \le n$, it follows that there exist points
$$\{ b_{i,1}, \ldots, b_{i,k_i} \} \subset (b_i, b_{i+1})
$$ such that, for all $1 \le j < k_i$, $C_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1} \}$ is the graph of a continuous map.
In particular, $C_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_i < b_{i,j+1} \}$ is the graph of $\mathbf{f}\vert_{Y_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1} \}}$.

Apply the same argument to $\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j$ (for $C_B$) so that, $C_T$ and $C_B$, if non-empty, are split into $1$-dimensional continuous curves which are graphs of continuous functions, and the intervals above $0$-dimensional blow-up points. Once this property has been satisfied, we are left with a similar construction of optimisation with constraints as in Section \@ref(sec:lagrange-refinement).

### Critical points of the top and bottom

We now discuss how to perform this refinement on the CAD structure. Let us assume that $C_T\ne \emptyset$, otherwise no refinement is needed. We must construct subsets $W \subset Y$ such that $f_j\vert_{W_T}$ is a smooth, continuous function.
Let
$$
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1, \ldots, {\cal A}_n)
$$
be the projection factor set as defined in Equation \@ref(eq:proj-fac-set) and
$$
C' := \projop{j-1}(C), C^j := \projop{j}(C),
$$
Begin with $j := \alpha+1$ so that $C'$ is a cylindrical sector cell and there exists an algebraic variety $V$ containing polynomials $g_2,\ldots,g_{j-1}$ with each $g_i \in {\cal A}_i, 2 \le i \le j-1$, defined in Equation \@ref(eq:c-alpha-top), such that $C'_T\subset V$.
By definition $$
C^j_T = \cl{C^j} \cap (C'_T \times \R)
$$ and there exists a polynomial $g_j \in {\cal A}_j$ such that $g_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in C^j_T$. Since $C^j_T$ is either empty or the graph of a continuous function everywhere except, possibly, over a finite number of blow-up points, we need to find $x_1$-coordinates of points in $C'_T$ such that $g_j$ vanishes over an open interval.
Since $C^j_T$ is $1$-dimensional, one way to achieve this is by computing a smooth stratification of $C^j_T$. If the
projection of a $1$-dimensional stratum onto $x_1$ is a $0$-dimensional point $b \in \R$, then $b$ is the $x_1$-coordinate of a blow-up point.

Alternatively, since the refinement points form a $0$-dimensional semialgebraic subset of $\R$, this set can be represented as a first-order Boolean formula
$$
\exists x_2,\ldots,x_{j-1} \exists_\infty x_j ((x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1}) \in C'_T, g_j(x_1,\ldots,g_j) = 0)
$$
where $\exists_\infty x$ is a special quantifier defined in `QEPCAD-B` meaning "there exist infinitely many values of $x$".
Using $\exists_\infty$, some of the costly computations with algebraic numbers can be avoided, thereby improving efficiency in practice [@qepcadDocs].
Theoretically speaking, [@bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21] provides a singly exponential upper bound for quantifier elimination.

Eliminating the $j-1$ quantifiers, we obtain the desired points $(b_{i,1},\ldots,b_{i,k_i})$, where each $b_{i,j}$ is the $x_1$-coordinate of a blow-up point of $g_j$.
Now we can assume that $C^j_T\cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1}\}$ is the graph of a continuous function. More precisely, the implicit function $g_j$ can be considered as a function from $C'_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1}\}$ to $\R$. We have a very similar construction as in Section \@ref(sec:lagrange-refinement).
That is, polynomials $g_2,\ldots,g_{j-1}$ will provide the constraints in the first $j-2$ columns of the matrix in Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det), while $\partial h / \partial x_i, 1 \le i \le j - 1$ in the last column should be replaced with $\partial g_j / \partial x_i$
Denote this polynomial by $J_T$, and repeat with $C^j_B$ if appropriate. Inequalities $s_1 g_{1,1} > 0, \ldots, s_1 g_{1,\ell} > 0$ (from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs)), $d_T \ne 0$ and $d_B$ (from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-qe-denominators)) are obtained and solved for $x_1$ in a very similar way as in Section \@ref(sec:lagrange-refinement). We obtain a set of refinement points
$$
\{ b_{j,1}, \ldots, b_{j,r_j} \} \subset (c_i,c_{i+1})
$$
such that each of $C^j_T$ and $C^j_B$ is either empty or the graph of a continuous, monotone function.

The process is completed by induction on $j$. Suppose that the refinement has been performed for $\alpha + 1 \le j$. If $j = n$ we are done, and $C$ is now monotone. Otherwise, we proceed to $j+1$. By the induction hypothesis, we know that $C^{j}_T \cap \{b_{j-1,i} < x_1 < b_{j-1,i+1}\}, 1 \le i < r_{j}$ is either empty or the graph of a continuous (monotone) function.
If $C^{j}_T = \emptyset$, there is nothing to do as $C^{j+1}_T$ is empty, too, and the process will terminate.
Otherwise, the new constraint $g_{j} \in {\cal A}_{j}$ is the polynomial defining $C^{j}_T$ and $g_j \in {\cal A}_j$ can be found such that $g_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in C^{j+1}_T$.
Perform the same computation described above, to refine $C^{j+1}_T$ such that $1$-dimensional components are graphs of continuous, monotone functions. Repeat with $C^{j+1}_B$.
As before, a set of refinement points
$$
\{b_{j+1,1}, \ldots, b_{j+1,r_{j+1}}\}
$$
is obtained.

The union of sets of refinement points $$
\{b_{\alpha + 1,1}, \ldots, b_{\alpha + 1,r_{\alpha + 1}}\} \cup \ldots \cup \{b_{n,1}, \ldots, b_{n,r_n}\}
$$
forms the refinement of $C$ into $2$-dimensional monotone cells.

Altogether, we have proved the following.

::: {.lemma #monotone-section-algorithm}
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a CAD of $\R^n$ compatible with each set $V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \R^n$ with $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ and such that each cell $C \subset V_i$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map, for $1\le i \le k$. Let
$$
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_n),
$$
where ${\cal A}_k \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k], 1 \le k \le n$, be the projection polynomials defining $\cal D$.

Then there is an algorithm, taking $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ as input, which produces a set of algebraic numbers $(c_1,\ldots,c_r)$ such that $C \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}$ is monotone. Each $c_i, 1 \le i \le r$ is represented by a pair $(m_i, J_i) \in \Z[x_1] \times \Q$ (see Equation \@ref(eq:algebraic-number).

## Pseudo-code {#sec:monotone-algorithm}

We now present psuedo-code for the monotone part of the algorithm.

::: {.algorithm data-latex="Monotone CAD"}
**Input:**
$$({\cal E}, {\cal A})$$

  - $\cal E$: a cylindrical algebraic decomposition of $\R^{k+n}$, such that each cell is the graph of a quasi-affine map. Each cell $C$ of $\cal E$ has a truth-value (*true* or *false* attached.

  - ${\cal A} = {\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_{k+n}$ is the family of projection polynomials where each ${\cal A}_i \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_i]$.

**Output:**
$$
{\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} = \{ c_1,\ldots,c_t \} \subset \A \mid \mathbf{b} \in \R^{k-1}  \}
$$
where $\mathbf{b} \in \R^{k-1}$ is a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell in the decomposition induced by ${\cal E}$ on $\R^k$,
such that, for each ${\cal R}_\mathbf{b}$, intersecting the sub-CAD $\cal D$ above $\mathbf{b}$ with straight lines and half-planes of the kind $\{x_1 < c_i \}, \{x_1 = c_i \}, \{x_1 > c_i\}, 1 \le i \le t$ results in a refinement of $\cal D$ such that each true cell of $\cal D$ with dimension at most $2$ is monotone.

First, define a subroutine
$$
{\rm sub}_{\mathbf{y}} (g) \mid g \in \Z[y_1,\ldots,y_m,x_1,\ldots,x_n], \mathbf{y} \in \A^m, n > 0,
$$
which computes $h := g(\mathbf{y}) \in \A[x_{1},\ldots,x_m]$ and returns the normalised polynomial of $h$, in
$\Z[x_{m+1},\ldots,x_n]$ (see Section \@ref(sec:sub-cad)).

It will be convenient to overload this operator and write ${\rm sub}_{\mathbf{y}} (L)$, where $L$ is a set (or list) of polynomials to mean $\{ {\rm sub}_{\mathbf{y}} (g) \mid g \in L \}$.

Now define a structure to store refinement polynomials
$$
{\cal F} := \{ {\cal F}_{\mathbf{b}} := \emptyset \mid \mathbf{b} \in \R^{k-1}, k > 0 \},
$$
$\mathbf{b}$ is a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell in the decomposition induced by ${\cal E}$ on $\R^{k-1}$.
and a similar structure to store refinement points
$$
{\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} := \emptyset \mid \mathbf{b} \in \R^{k-1}, k > 0 \}
$$
$\mathbf{b}$ is a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell in the decomposition induced by ${\cal E}$ on $\R^{k-1}$.
*(Note: for each $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell $\mathbf{b}$, ${\cal F}_\mathbf{b}$ is a set of univariate polynomials, ${\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}}$ is the set of roots of polynomials ${\cal F}_\mathbf{b}$. When $k=1$, then the CAD of $\R^0$ consisting of the unique point of $\R^0$ is used -- practically speaking, we work directly with the CAD $\cal E$.)*

Let $\mathbf{b}$ be a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell of the decomposition induced by $\cal E$ on $\R^{k-1}, k > 0$. Let $\cal D$ be the sub-decomposition of $\R^n$ of $\cal E$ above $\mathbf{b}$.

Consider each cell $C$ of $\cal D$ with truth value *true*. Let $C$ have index
$$
(0,\ldots,0,1,i_{k+1},\ldots,i_{k+n})
$$
in $\cal E$. If $i_{k+1} + \cdots + i_n > 2$, then $\dim(C) > 2$ and the algorithm will fail. Otherwise, let $\alpha$ be the smallest among $x+1,\ldots,k+n$ such that $i_{k+1} = \ldots = i_{\alpha - 1} = 0$ and $i_\alpha = 1$.
Then:

- Let

  - $\mathbf{b} := \projop{k-1}(C)$,

    *(Note: observe that $\mathbf{b} \in A^{k-1}$. If $k = 1$, then $\mathbf{b}$ is the unique cell, $\mathbf{0}$, in the CAD of $\R^0$. In this case, it is clear that ${\rm sub}_\mathbf{0} (g) \equiv g$.)*

  - $C'' \subset \A := \projop{k}(C)$ ($(1)$-cell), and let $(C''_B, C''_T)$ be $(0)$-cells which are the endpoints of $C''$,

  - ${\cal G} := {\rm sub}_{\mathbf{b}} \{ g_i \mid k+1 \le i \le \alpha - 1, g_i \in {\cal A}_i, g_i(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \projop{\alpha-1}(C) \}$,

  - $C' := \projop{\alpha}(C)$.

- $C'_T$ and $C'_B$ be the top and bottom, respectively, $C'$.

(*Note: If $C'$ is not bounded from above (resp. below) by a continuous definable function, i.e., there is no section above (resp. below) $C'$, then let $C'_T := \emptyset$ (resp $C'_B$) and skip any computations involving $C'_T$ (resp $C'_B$).)*

- Let $j = \alpha$ and do:

  - **(*)** For $\delta \in \{B, T\}$, if $C_\delta$ is not empty, do:

    - Let $\rm{sub}_{\mathbf{b}} (g_j) \in \Z[x_{k+1,\ldots,x_j}]$ be such that $g_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in C'_\delta$.

    - Compute
    $$
f_\delta := \det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{k+1}}{\partial x_{k}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{j-1}}{\partial x_{k}} & \dfrac{\partial g_{j}}{\partial x_{k}}\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{k+1}}{\partial x_{j-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{j-1}}{\partial x_{j-1}} & \dfrac{\partial g_{j}}{\partial x_{j-1}}
\end{pmatrix},
    $$
from Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det), using constraints $g_{k+1},\ldots,g_{\alpha+1}$, and discarding denominators $\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_\alpha$ of the total derivatives in the last column.

  - Let $${\cal H} := \{ g_{k+1},\ldots,g_{j-1}, f_B, f_T \}$$
be a set of polynomials and compute
$$
{\cal F}_{\mathbf{b}} := {\cal F}_{\mathbf{b}} \cup \projop{1}({\cal H}) \subset \Z[x_k].
$$

  - If $j < n$, then

    - Add $g_j$ to $\cal G$, i.e., let
      $$
      {\cal G} := {\cal G} \cup \{ g_j \}.
      $$

    - Let $j := j+1$.

    - Let
      $$

## Correctness and complexity

The correctness of the algorithm from Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm) follows from @bgv15, Theorem 3.20 and
Lemma 3.19, and is proved in Lemmas \@ref(lem:monotone-sector-algorithm) and \@ref(lem:monotone-section-algorithm).
The algorithm described in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm) considers each $2$-dimensional cell in a sub-CAD $\mathcal{E}$ of $\R^n$ above a $0$-dimensional cell $\mathbf{b} \in \R^{k-1}$. This is exactly the inductive step of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20, where an $(i_1,0,\ldots,0,i_{\alpha},0,\ldots,0)$-cell, where $i_1 = i_\alpha = 1$, is considered.
By Corollary \@ref(cor:gamma-top-bottom) to $C$, the $2$-dimensional subset $X \subset \opspan{x_1,x_\alpha}$ is
obtained. The first part of @bgv15, Lemma 3.18 describes how $X$ should be refined into $2$-dimensional semi-monotone sets. The construction described in Section \@ref(sec:quasi-affine) explains how to obtain the set of refinement points $(c_1,\ldots,c_t) \subset \A$.
$C$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map $\mathbf{f} = (f_{i_1},\ldots,f_{i_{n-2}})$ where each component $f_j \colon X \to \opspan{x_j}$ for $j \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{1,\alpha\}$ is a quasi-affine function. The second part of @bgv15, Lemma 3.18 describes how to refine $X$ such that each function $f_j$ is monotone. By @bgv15, Lemma 3.16, if every component $f_i$ is monotone on a subset in the refinement of $X$, then the map $\mathbf{f}$ itself is monotone on that subset of $X$.
The construction described in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-sections) describes how to find the refinement points to ensure that $\mathbf{f}$ is a monotone map.
Thus, the construction in this section satisfies the properties required in the proof of @bgv15, Lemma 3.18 for $C$ to be monotone.

### Complexity { #sec:monotone-complexity }

Let $C$ be a $(0,\ldots,0,i_j,0,\ldots,0,i_k,0\ldots,0)$-cell, with $i_j = i_k = 1$.
The Jacobi determinant, defined in Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det-2), is computed for all $k \le \ell \le n$.
As discussed in Section \@ref(sec:quasi-complexity), the determinant of a $(k \times k)$-matrix of polynomials with maximum degree $d$ is a polynomial of maximum degree $kd$.
Also from Section \@ref(sec:quasi-complexity), the complexity of computing the CAD with quasi-affine cells is
$$
(s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}},
$$
which, according to Proposition \@ref(prp:collins), is also an upper bound on the number of polynomials, their degree and the number of cells in this CAD.
Thus, the degree of the polynomial defined in Equation \@ref(eq:jacobi-det) is at most $n\cdot(s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}}$, which is asymptotically the same as
$(s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}}$.

We then compute the $x_1$-coordinates of the solutions to the $0$-dimensional system of equations (defined in Equations \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve)), subject to the inequalities (defined in Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-ineqs)). In the implementation, CAD projection is used to compute a family of polynomials ${\cal F}$, defined in Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve-projected), such that the required refinement points contain their roots.
As we are well aware, the number of polynomials and their degrees will be doubly exponential in $n$. However, a better bound on the number of refinement points can be obtained.
Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve) defines two systems of $\alpha - 1$ equations in $\alpha - 1$ unknowns and both systems have a finite number of solutions.
A generalisation of Bezout's Theorem (see @masser1983) states that, over an algebraically closed field, if a system of $n$ polynomial equations, having degrees $d_1,\ldots,d_n$, in $n$ unknowns has a finite number of solutions, then this number, counted with multiplicities, is at most the product $d_1 \cdots d_n$. This will be an upper bound on the number of different real solutions to the system of polynomials. Since we only have an upper bound on the maximum degree $d$ of polynomials appearing in the systems from Equation \@ref(eq:lagrange-solve), then there are at most $d^n$ distinct real solutions to the system.
An even tighter bound can be obtained by considering the number of connected components of the algebraic set defined by this system of equations.
Indeed, the number of connected components of a definable set is given by the $0$-th Betti number, $b_0$, of the set.
@gv2009 Section 6.1 present some bounds on the total Betti number -- sum of Betti numbers of all orders -- ${\tt{b}}(S)$ of a semialgebraic set $S \subset \R^n$.
For a semialgebraic set $S \subset \R^n$ defined by a conjunction of any number of polynomials having maximum degree $d$, ${\tt{b}}(S) \le d(2d - 1)^{n-1}$ [@gv2009, Section 6.1 (a)].
This bound is sufficient for our situation because the inequalities define a subset of these roots.
Using the upper bound on the degrees of polynomials defining the CAD and the determinant of the matrix, along with the bound on the number of roots given by Bezout's theorem, we get a bound for the number of refinement points of
$$
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{n \cdot \O(1)^{n}}.
$$
This is asymptotically the same as
$$
(s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}}.
$$

For the cell $C$, this process is repeated at most $2(n-2)$ times, and then repeated for each $2$-dimensional cell in the CAD contained in the input set $V$.
There are at most
$$
(s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}}
$$
cells in total, which is obviously an upper bound on the cells of dimension $2$. Thus, we get an upper bound on the number of refinement points of
$$
\left((s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}}\right)^2
$$
which is asymptotically the same as
$$
(s(d+1))^{\O(1)^{n}}.
$$
Thus, we obtain a bound on the total number of refinement points, which is asymptotically the same as the bound on the number of cells in the CAD containing quasi-affine cells. This gives us an upper bound on the complexity, number of cells, number of polynomials and degrees defining a CAD which is monotone with respect to all $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.

## Computing the refinements { #sec:compute-refinement }

We now describe how to refine the CAD $\cal D$ to be compatible with the refinement points in $\cal R$.

For $0 \le k \le n$, consider each refinement point $\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_{k-1}, c_k) \in {\cal R}_k$. It is important to note that refinement points appear in ascending order.
Let ${\cal D}'$ be the sub-CAD of $\R^{n-k}$ above $(c_1,\ldots,c_k)$, which is a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell of the CAD induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^k$ and let ${\cal D}''$ be the CAD induced by ${\cal D}'$ on $\R^{k+1}$. We want to refine ${\cal D}''$ such that $\mathbf{c}$ is a new $(0)$-cell.
We need only to consider coordinate $k+1$ of $\mathbf{c}$. Denote it by $c_{k+1}$.
For each $(0)$-cell $b_{k+1}$ of ${\cal D}''$, compute $s := \sign(b_{k+1} - c_{k+1})$. If $s \le 0$, consider the next $(0)$-cell in ${\cal D}''$. Otherwise, $s > 0$ and there is a $(1)$-cell $C$ in ${\cal D}''$ such that $c_{k+1} \in C$. This is the cell we need to refine.
Make two new copies of $C$, so that we have three identical cells $C_1,C_2,C_3$. Recall that, to each cell belongs a
sample point and possibly some other information. E.g., in `QEPCAD-B`, each cell has a set of signs of projection factors, which should remain unchanged, and a positional index which describes where in the CAD the cell can be found. Let $C_1$ have positional index $(j_1,\ldots,j_k,j_{k+1})$. New cells $C_2$ and $C_3$ should have positional indices $(j_1,\ldots,j_k,j_{k+1} + 1$ and $(j_1,\ldots,j_k,j_{k+1}+2)$ respectively. For each existing cell with positional index $(l_1,\ldots,l_k,l_{k+1})$ with $l_k+1 > j_{k+1}$, the index should be updated to $(l_1,\ldots,l_k,l_{k+1} + 2)$. We now need to update the sample points. The sample point of the section cell $C_2$ should be $\mathbf{c}$. This might turn out to be the case by chance. In this case, there is nothing to be done with $C_2$ and the sample points of sector cells $C_1$ and $C_3$ are incorrect. Otherwise, $\mathbf{c}$ is either greater than the sample point of $C_1$, in which case the sample point of $C_1$ is already correct, or $\mathbf{c}$ is less than $C_3$, in which case the sample point of $C_3$ is already correct. I.e., in every case, exactly two of the sample points of the cells $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$ must be updated.
Let $C$ be the open interval $(a_1,a_2)$. If the sample point of $C_1$ needs to be updated, then set it to $(a_1 + c_{k+1}) / 2$ and if the sample point of $C_3$ needs updating, then set it to $(c_{k+1} + a_2) / 2$. Observe that, if we have updated the sample point of a cell $C$, then the sample points of every cell which projects on $C$ are now incorrect.
Since polynomials are delineable over the original cell, then they will be delineable over the smaller cells in the refinement, so we simply need to run the sample point computation part of the lifting phase recursively on the stack above $C$. This involves evaluating each level $k+1$ projection factor $f$ at the new sample point $\mathbf{b}$ and finding the roots of the (possibly algebraic) univariate polynomial $f(\mathbf{b},x_n)$.

Repeating this process with each refinement point in $\mathbf{R}_k$, we obtain the refinement described in [@bgv15, Lemma 3.11].
