some of the improvements in the implementation of CAD and quantifier elimination via
CAD, and provides somewhat more detail on extensions to the system that go beyond
quantifier elimination. The author is responsible for most of the extended features
of QEPCAD B, but improvements to the basic CAD implementation and to the SACLIB library
on which QEPCAD is based are the results of many people's work, including: George
E. Collins, Mark J. Encarnaci\'{o}n, Hoon Hong, Jeremy Johnson, Werner Krandick, Richard

This algorithm improves the complexity of the asymptotically fastest algorithm for this problem, known to this data. A new feature of this algorithm is that the role of the algebraic part (the dependence on the degrees of the imput polynomials) and the combinatorial part (the dependence on the number of polynomials) are sparated. Another new feature is that the degrees of the polynomials in the equivalent quantifier-free formula that is output, are independent of the number of input polynomials. As special cases of this algorithm new and improved algorithms for deciding a sentence in the first order theory over real closed fields, and also for solving the existential problem in the first order theory over real closed fields, are obtained.},

    abstract = {Computational complexity theory provides a framework for understanding the cost of solving computational problems, as measured by the requirement for resources such as time and space. The objects of study are algorithms defined within a formal model of computation. Upper bounds on the computational complexity of a problem are usually derived by constructing and analyzing specific algorithms. Meaningful lower bounds on computational complexity are harder to come by, and are not available for most problems of interest. The dominant approach in complexity theory is to consider algorithms as oper­ ating on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. Such strings may represent various discrete objects such as integers or algebraic expressions, but cannot rep­ resent real or complex numbers, unless the numbers are rounded to approximate values from a discrete set. A major concern of the theory is the number of com­ putation steps required to solve a problem, as a function of the length of the input string.},

In this first-ever graduate textbook on the algorithmic aspects of real algebraic geometry, the main ideas and techniques presented form a coherent and rich body of knowledge, linked to many areas of mathematics and computing. Mathematicians already aware of real algebraic geometry will find relevant information about the algorithmic aspects, and researchers in computer science and engineering will find the required mathematical background. Being self-contained the book is accessible to graduate students and even, for invaluable parts of it, to undergraduate students. This revised second edition contains several recent results, notably on discriminants of symmetric matrices, real root isolation, global optimization, quantitative results on semi-algebraic sets and the first single exponential algorithm computing their first Betti number. An index of notation has also been added.},

  abstract = {A key component of the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (cad) algorithm of Collins (1975) is the projection operation: the projection of a set A of r-variate polynomials is defined to be a certain set or (r-1)-variate polynomials. Tile zeros of the polynomials in the projection comprise a “shadow” of the critical zeros of A. The cad algorithm proceeds by forming successive projections of the input set A, each projection resulting in the elimination of one variable. This paper is concerned with a refinement to the cad algorithm, and to its projection operation in particular. It is shown, using a theorem from complex analytic geometry, that the original projection set for trivariate polynomials that Collins used can be substantially reduced in size, without affecting its essential properties. Observations suggest that the reduction in the projection set size leads to a substantial decrease in the computing time of the cad algorithm.}

We shall outline two of these. The first one is the fact that a real root ξ of a polynomial P of degree n with real coefficients may be distinguished from the other real roots of P by the signs of the derivatives Pi of P at ξ, i = 1, ..., n - 1. This offers a new possibility for the coding of real algebraic numbers and for computation with these numbers (see section 2). The second is based on a generalisation of Thom's lemma to the case of several variables. It gives, after a linear change of coordinates, a cylindric algebraic decomposition of a semi- algebraic set where the incidence relation between the cells is easily obtained (see section 3).}
