Algebraic geometry is a fundamental and active area of research in mathematics and, loosely speaking, is concerned with
studying sets which can be defined by polynomials. A fundamental object in algebraic geometry is the algebraic variety,
a set defined by the simultaneous solutions to a system of polynomial equations. Sometimes, a wider class of sets,
semialgebraic sets, which are defined by a Boolean combination of polynomial equations and inequalities, are studied. Complex algebraic geometry involves working over an algebraically closed field, where the fundamental theorem of algebra holds, while in real algebraic geometry we are restricted to the real numbers. The focus of this research is on algorithms for computing with semialgebraic sets defined over the real numbers.
Computational algebraic geometry spans both mathematics and computer science and involves developing algorithms for working with the fundamental objects of algebraic geometry, e.g., algebraic varieties, polynomial ideals and semialgebraic sets.
Some fundamental results in this area were presented at the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation which was held in Marseille in 1979 (now part of ISSAC).
\citet{buchberger1979} presented his criterion and an algorithm for computing a Groebner basis for a polynomial ideal defined over a real closed field, which is still one of the most efficient methods for finding the complex solution of a systems of multivariate polynomial equations.
\citet{lazard1979} also presented an algorithm, based on Macalay's multivariate resultants, for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations over any field (algebraically closed or otherwise), which has complexity singly exponential in the number of unknowns.
\citet{arnon1979} described an extension to Collins' algorithm for computing cylindrical decompositions of real space, which allows one to determine the dimension of a semialgebraic set and deduce some of its topological properties.
Since then, there have been many advances in these areas, both in extending the applications of these algorithms and making them more efficient.

A fundamental result in real algebraic geometry is Tarski's Theorem \citep{vdd1988tarski}, which states that semialgebraic sets are closed under projection.
This result is not true for algebraic sets, neither real nor complex. Indeed, consider the projection of the solutions of the polynomial \(xy = 1\) onto the \(x\)-axis. We get \(\mathbb{R}\setminus \{ 0 \}\), which is not an algebraic set, but could be represented if we are allowed to use inequalities. Thus, we will be working over the category of semialgebraic sets: sets of points defined by Boolean combinations of polynomial equations and inequalities.
Alfred Tarski first alluded, without proof, to his famous theorem in the abstract of \citet{sierpinski1930}. He then proved the
theorem in \citep{tarski1998} whose planned publication in 1939 was delayed due to the war. \citet{seidenberg1954} published ``A New
Decision Method for Elementary Algebra'', which applies Tarski's theorem to quantifier elimination problems over real
closed fields, leading to the well-known Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem.
\citet{lojasiewicz1964} gives a constructive proof of the Tarski--Seidenberg theorem using successive projections onto \(n-1\)-dimensional space. This is the idea behind the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) algorithm.
The notion and algorithm for computing a CAD was presented by \citet{collins1975}.
The algorithm partitions \(\mathbb{R}^n\) into cylindrical cells -- semialgebraic sets such that the projection of any two of them is either disjoint or coincides.
Collins' algorithm is the first computationally tractable proof of the Tarski--Seidenberg theorem, the algorithm having complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables.
CAD has wide ranging applications in real algebraic geometry.
Perhaps the most famous application is the one Collins was thinking of -- quantifier elimination: given a Boolean formula where literals are polynomial equations and inequalities and some variables are bound by \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) quantifiers, return a Boolean formula without quantifiers representing the same set.
A similar problem uses CAD to decide whether a formula in which all variables are quantified is true or false -- the decision problem.
More recently, alternative methods for performing quantifier elimination have been proposed, e.g., the critical point method (see \citet{safeldin2013}).
Other notable uses include determining whether a semialgebraic set is empty, computing the real roots of a system of multivariate polynomials and determining the dimension of a semialgebraic set. \citet{bpr98} employs the critical point method to the emptiness problem, obtaining a bound singly exponential in the number of variables and \citet{koiran1999} proved that determining the dimension of a semialgebraic set is \({\mathrm{NP}}_{\mathbb{R}}\)-complete, obtaining a singly exponential bound.
CAD can also be used to deduce topological properties of semialgebraic sets, for example by computing homologies.

The CAD algorithm is still an active and interesting area of study, with two main strands of research. Since the complexity of computing a CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables, the algorithm can be intractable for even moderately-sized problems. It is impossible to lower this theoretical bound. Indeed \citet{davenportHeintz1988} prove that quantifier elimination by CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables.
They present an example of a first-order Boolean formula with quantifiers which requires a linear number of symbols while the formula obtained after quantifier elimination requires a doubly exponential number of symbols.
\citet{brown07} later presented a simple and constructive proof of the same thing, giving an example of a formula with only one free variable and containing only linear polynomials whose quantifier-free counterpart is doubly exponential in length.

CAD depends on a fixed coordinate ordering and this can greatly influence the number of cells produced. In the same paper, \citet{brown07} show that the same input may produce a linear number of cells for one ordering, but a doubly exponential number of cells for another. They also present an example for which every coordinate ordering yields a doubly exponential number of cells \citep{brown07}.
In some applications, we may be able to change the coordinate ordering. As such, one way to ``speed up'' CAD construction would be to find a coordinate ordering which yields the smallest number of cells. \citet{hong1993} was one of the first to do this, using best first search, a heuristic search technique in AI, to find an optimal ordering. More recent developments include \citet{delrio2022}, who used complexity analysis to improve upon the current state-of-the-art heuristics, obtaining benchmark results 17 times slower than the theoretical best, while the state-of-the-art performs 25 times slower than the theoretical best.
In addition, modern AI and machine learning techniques are being investigated as a means of finding the best coordinate ordering. For example, \citet{huang2014} employed support vector machines and \citet{chen2020} used artificial neural networks to identify an optimal ordering.
Both of these techniques outperformed classical heuristics, making this a promising application of AI and ML.

However, in many cases we cannot change the coordinate ordering and, even if we could, \citet{brown07} showed that for some inputs all coordinate orderings yield a doubly exponential number of cells. As such, making optimisations in the CAD algorithm itself has been an active area of study since Collins published his original algorithm in the 70s. Collins' algorithm works on the principal of projection and lifting. First, successive projections of input polynomials are performed, until we obtain a set of polynomials in one variable. The roots of these polynomials are isolated and then ``stacks'' of cells above each root and each interval in between the roots are constructed. The CAD of \(n\)-dimensional space is obtained by iterating this process, called the ``lifting phase''.
Minimising the number of polynomials produced by the projection operation means fewer computations are needed during the lifting phase. \citet{mccallum1998} proposed an improved projection operator, observing that some polynomials included in Collins' original projection operator can be removed. Many other projection operators, e.g., Hong's (see \citet{hong1990}) Lazard's projection (see \citet{mccallum2019}) have been proposed, each offering different properties. Another optimisation is to construct a ``partial CAD'', proposed by \citet{collins1991}. The idea is to use truth evaluation while constructing cells, taking quantifiers into account, so that only the cells we care about will be computed. As we do not have to ensure constant sign no every polynomial, this approach leads to savings during the lifting phase. The CAD algorithm has also been modified, often by weakening its properties, to solve specific problems. E.g., \citet{mccallum1993} presents an algorithm, based on CAD, for deciding the consistency of a system of strict polynomial inequalities. These modifications often have much better complexity than the classical CAD, while producing sufficient decompositions to solve the problem at hand.

A different strand of research, which is the main focus of this thesis, is to compute cylindrical decompositions in which the cells have certain desirable properties. This contrasts with the optimisations previously discussed, as these CADs often contain more cells than those constructed using the classical algorithm. However, this trade-off is worthwhile because the additional conditions make the CADs more powerful.
Indeed, \citet{pianomovers1983} apply cylindrical algebraic decomposition to a motion planning problem in which one wants to find a path, or prove that none exists, for a rigid (possibly hinged) body to move through a space defined by a configuration of walls. This has obvious applications in robotics. In order to solve this problem, cells are required to be arranged in a particular way: the closure of every cell must be a union of cells in the decomposition. Using classical CAD, this condition cannot always be satisfied, but \citet{pianomovers1983} prove the classical algorithm is sufficient if a linear change of coordinates is made.
These CADs are also useful if we wish to compute topological properties of semialgebraic sets. For example, \citet{reif1979} gives an algorithm for computing the homology groups of an arbitrary real algebraic variety. As we alluded to earlier, over the reals, a formula cannot tell us much about the set it defines, so this is useful for deducing properties of semialgebraic sets, e.g., how many ``holes'' it has, or whether it is connected.
Along similar lines, \citet{arnon1984} present an algorithm to compute a CAD of the plane along with information about which cells ``touch each other''. They extend this result to 3-dimensional space in \citep{arnon1987}. In order to compute these cell adjacencies, we again need the property that the closure of every cell is a union of cells in the decomposition. \citet{arnon1987} achieve this without making a change of coordinates.

Another desirable property is that every cell in a cylindrical decomposition is a topologically regular cell. Loosely speaking, this means that each \(k\)-dimensional cell and its closure is homeomorphic to a \(k\)-dimensional sphere and its closure.
This property can fail in the region of points where polynomials are not ``well behaved''.
E.g., points where a polynomial vanishes over an open interval (for the precise definition, see Definition
\ref{def:blow-up-point}).
For example, consider the Whitney umbrella, the set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) which satisfy the equation \(f = 0\) where
\[
f := x^2 - y^2 z.
\]
At almost every point \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2\), \(f\) is well-behaved. having only one value of \(z\) at which it is equal to zero.
However, \(f\) ``blows up'' above the origin, vanishing at every point. This causes interesting behaviour as \((x,y)\) approaches the origin, because the \(z\)-coordinate tends to infinity. Thus, the set
\begin{equation}
\{ 0 < x < 1, -1 < y < 1, x^2 - y^2 z = 0 \},
\label{eq:basic-semialgebraic-whit}
\end{equation}
which is a cylindrical cell in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), is not topologically regular and its closure contains the half-line \(\{ x = 0, y = 0, z \ge 0 \}\).
We will study CAD containing blow-up points and cells which are not topologically regular throughout this thesis.
\citet{lazard10} presents an algorithm which produces such a decomposition, in the potential presence of these blow-up points, for dimension \(\le 3\). This so-called ``strong'' cylindrical algebraic decomposition consists of only topologically regular cells and the closure of every cell is a union of some cells in the decomposition. \citet{lazard10} takes an algebraic approach, employing techniques such as computing the saturation of a polynomial ideal, to make computations efficient and explains how the algorithm can be implemented in Maple.
Many inputs to the CAD algorithm do not contain blow-up points. \citet{jhd20} prove that the classical CAD algorithm will produce a strong decomposition for the given coordinate ordering and regardless of the method used to compute it. This is a very useful result as it allows us to take advantage of the nice properties of strong decompositions without doing any extra work to obtain them.
However, sometimes blow-up points are unavoidable. For example, \citet{bgv15} propose an algorithm for computing a triangulation of a definable monotone family which relies on a strong cylindrical decomposition of that family. Since these families depend on a fixed coordinate ordering and frequently contain blow-up points, we must be able to compute these strong decompositions in arbitrary dimension, in the potential presence of blow-ups and without having to make a change of coordinates.

Note that, in Equation \eqref{eq:basic-semialgebraic-whit}, we write a basic semialgebraic set of the form
\[
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \land \ldots \land f_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \land g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \land \ldots \land g_\ell(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}
\]
as
\[
\{ f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, f_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_\ell(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}.
\]
I.e., commas represent conjunction. When not ambiguous, this convention will be used throughout.

\citet{bgv15} present a constructive proof that, given a family \(V := (V_1,\ldots,V_k)\) of bounded definable sets in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) for all \(1 \le i \le k\), there exists a cylindrical decomposition in which each \(V_i, 1 \le i \le k\) is a union of cells, such that every cell contained in \(V_i\) is monotone and its closure is the union of cells in the decomposition. A monotone cell is a stronger property than topological regularity and, by \citet{bgv13} Theorem 1, all monotone cells are topologically regular. Their proof explains how such a decomposition can be constructed and depends on classical CAD and simple tools such as refinements by linear equations and splitting two-dimensional cells by using a given curve interval.
The main goal of this thesis will be to design and implement an algorithm, based on this result, for constructing such a decomposition in the semialgebraic case.
The constructive proof works for more general definable sets and, in contrast to e.g.~\citet{collins1975} or \citet{lazard10}, is geometric in nature. As such, the properties we need to satisfy in order to complete the construction are described in detail but not the methods used to obtain them. For example, we are asked to consider critical points of the smooth 2-dimensional locus of a union of definable sets, or consider the boundary of a 2-dimensional cylindrical cell.
We will use a combination of fundamental tools in differential geometry, e.g., partial derivatives and Jacobi determinants, well-known algorithms in algebraic geometry such as smooth stratification and quantifier elimination, and ideas from optimisation, such as Lagrange multipliers.

A similar idea to that presented by \citet{bgv15} is discussed by \citet{vdd1998} (Section 2.19), who introduces the concept of a Van-den-Dries regular cell.

\begin{definition}
\citep[Section 2.19]{vdd1998}
We say that a cylindrical cell \(C \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is Van-den-Dries regular if, for all \(i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\), if two distinct points \(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y} \in C\) are such that \(x_1 = y_1, \ldots, x_{i-1} = y_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n = y_n\), but \(x_i < y_i\), then for all \(z_i\) such that \(x_i < z_i < y_i\), \((x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1},z_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n) \in C\).
\end{definition}

All two-dimensional Van-den-Dries regular cells are topologically regular, so if \(\dim(V_1,\ldots,V_k)\), the
decomposition described by \citet{vdd1998} will consist of topologically regular cells. The result of \citet{bgv15} is stronger in that the monotone decomposition is obtained for a family of sets which individually have dimension at most two.

Part of the result from \citet{bgv15} will be generalised to sets of arbitrary dimension. In particular, a novel algorithm for constructing a cylindrical decomposition, compatible with a semialgebraic set and suc that the boundary of every cell is the union of cells in the decomposition, will be presented. (This work was presented, in extended abstract form, at ISSAC 2023 and has also been submitted to the Journal of Symbolic computation.)
It will be proved that such a decomposition can be constructed in any dimension and without a preliminary change of coordinates even in the presence of blow-ups. A CAD is compatible with a set \(S\) if \(S\) is the union of some cells of the CAD. Frontier condition means that the closure of every cell is a union of some cells in the decomposition.
To our knowledge, this is the first proof that such a CAD exists without the change of coordinates.
We present the proof in the form of an algorithm which constructs a CAD compatible with a semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) and satisfying the frontier condition.
An upper bound on complexity is obtained. This is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials and degree of polynomials in the CAD. The algorithm has \emph{elementary} complexity (in the sense of L. Kalmar, see e.g.,
\citep[\(\S 57\)]{kleene1952}). This means that the complexity can be expressed as a power tower of finite height.

The frontier condition is useful in computing topological properties of semialgebraic sets defined by first-order Boolean formulas. For example, these decompositions can be viewed as closure-finite weak cell complexes (CW-complexes) and their homologies can be computed. In addition, cell adjacencies can easily be computed and motion-planning problems, for instance the well-known ``piano-mover's problem'' presented by Schwartz and Sharir can be solved, leading to applications in robotics.

It was shown by \citet{pianomovers1983} that it is relatively easy to satisfy the frontier condition after a generic linear rotation of coordinates in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). The rotation removes the need to lift over blow-up points. However, such a rotation of coordinates may be undesirable, or even impossible, in some applications.

An important application relates to the work of \citet{bgv15}, who present an algorithm for computing the triangulation of a definable monotone family. This algorithm requires a CAD of the family such that every cell is topologically regular and satisfies the frontier condition. Since the definable monotone family depends on the initial coordinate ordering, a rotation of coordinates is not allowed. \citet{jhd20} prove that if a CAD is \emph{well-based} then it satisfies these properties.
A CAD is well-based if it contains no \emph{bad cells}: cells above which one of the polynomials defining the CAD vanishes identically. These occur frequently in definable monotone families. Therefore, an algorithm for computing CAD with frontier condition, compatible with sets containing blow-ups and without a change of coordinates, is needed. Such a CAD algorithm is presented by the authors for sets of dimension not greater than two. \citep{bgv15} The algorithm presented in this paper provides a step towards extending their result to decompositions compatible with sets (and potentially triangulations of definable monotone families) of arbitrary dimension.

In addition, the result can be applied to other categories, e.g., semialgebraic sets defined by \emph{fewnomials} (see Section @ref\{sec:pfaffian)), whose structure is destroyed by a change of coordinates.

The result can also be easily extended to semialgebraic sets defined by first-order Boolean formulas with quantifiers.
Indeed, by Theorem @ref\{thm:proj\}, the projection of a CAD with frontier condition to any dimension also satisfies the frontier condition, and quantifier elimination requires considering projections of the CAD.

\citet{arnon1984} also made important developments in constructing cylindrical algebraic decompositions with frontier condition. They propose an algorithm for constructing a ``proper'\,' CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^2\), a similar notion to the \emph{well-based} CAD. Their algorithm also computes the cell adjacencies for this CAD.
The same authors extend this result to proper CADs of \(\mathbb{R}^3\), along with computing cell adjacencies.\citep{arnon1987}
\citet{lazard10} also presents an algorithm for obtaining a CAD in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) for \(n \le 3\) satisfying the frontier condition without a change of coordinates. Lazard takes an algebraic approach and the complexity of the algorithm presented is the same as that of classical CAD, while our construction uses a recursion on the lexicographical order of cell indices. A novel approach was needed because it is not clear how the above results could be extended to dimension greater than \(3\).

Finally, we will also describe an algorithm for computing a smooth stratification of a semialgebraic set. A smooth stratification is a finite partition of a set into smooth manifolds called ``strata''. We present an algorithm, based on the work of \citet{gv1995} for computing a smooth stratification of a semialgebraic set such that each stratum is nicely defined, meaning that each stratum of codimension \(k\) is defined by \(k\) different polynomials.
The algorithm is designed to handle input sets which are not nicely defined. E.g., sets defined by polynomials whose first partial derivatives vanish at every point in the set.
For example, the algebraic set
\[
S := \{ x y = 0 \}
\]
has codimension one, and thus can be defined by a single polynomial. However, it is not smooth, since \(S' = (0,0)\) is a singular point of \(S\). \(S'\) has codimension \(2\) and it is clear that it can be written using two polynomials
\[
S' = \{ x = 0, y = 0 \}.
\]
Observe that \(x\) and \(y\) are the first derivatives of the defining function \(xy\). However,
\[
\{ x^m y^n = 0, m \ge 1, n \ge 1 \}
\]
defines the set \(S\) and, if \(m > 1\),
\[
\dfrac{\partial x^m y^n}{\partial x} = m x^{m-1} y^n
\]
is equal to zero at the same points as \(x^my^n\). Thus, it may not be sufficient to find the points at which only the first derivatives vanish. This is the basic idea of the smooth stratification algorithm we will present.
The algorithm also ensures that only the \(k\) functions required to define a stratum of codimension \(k\) are included, ``pruning'' functions which do not add any additional information.

\section{Structure of this thesis}\label{structure-of-this-thesis}}

Chapter \ref{sec:background} gives some necessary definitions, then presents some useful results from \citet{bgv15}. The CAD
is then formally defined, and the flow of the algorithm, following the description given by \citet{coste2000} is outlined.
Chapter \ref{sec:smooth-strat} presents the smooth stratification algorithm from \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2.
The construction is made concrete, leading to an algorithm, presented as psuedo-code, for the semialgebraic case. This algorithm has been implemented in C on top of SACLIB. Saclib is an open-source C/C++ library for manipulating real polynomials and real algebraic numbers and working with their solutions as real algebraic numbers (see \citet{saclib}).
The following is proved, the main contribution being the complexity result for the semialgebraic case.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:strat}{}\label{thm:strat}Let
\[
X := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1 = 0, \ldots, f_k = 0, g_1 > 0, \ldots, g_\ell > 0 \},
\]
be a semialgebraic set defined by \(s = k + \ell\) different polynomials of maximum degree \(d\).
Then there is an algorithm, without oracle, which partitions \(X\) into a family
\[
{\cal X} = (X_0, \ldots, X_n)
\]
such that, if \(X\) is nonsingular, \(X_0 = X\) and all other sets are empty.
Otherwise, \(X_0 = \emptyset\) and each \(X_k, 1 \le k \le n\) is a possibly empty, effectively nonsingular stratum of codimension \(k\).
This algorithm has complexity
\[
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}.
\]
The number of strata does not exceed \(s^{n} (d + 1)^2\), and each stratum is defined by at most \(s (d + 1)^2\) polynomial equations and inequalities of maximum degree \((d + 1)^2\).
\end{theorem}

Chapters \ref{sec:quasi-affine}, \ref{sec:monotone-cells} and \ref{sec:frontier-bgv} concern the construction from
\citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:bgv-main}{}\label{prp:bgv-main}\citep[Theorem 3.20]{bgv15}

Let \(V_1, \ldots, V_k\) be bounded deﬁnable subsets in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with \(\dim V_i \le 2\) for each \(1 \le i \le k\).
Then there is a cylindrical cell decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying the frontier condition, and monotone with respect to each \(V_1, \ldots, V_k\).
\end{proposition}

The main contribution is an algorithm for constructing the cylindrical decomposition described in \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20, for the semialgebraic case.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:bgv-algorithm}{}\label{thm:bgv-algorithm}Let
\[
F_1,\ldots,F_k
\]
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas containing \(s\) different polynomials \(\mathbf{F} = \{ f_1,\ldots, f_s \} \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), having maximum degree \(d\), such that \(F_i, 1\le i \le k\) defines a bounded semialgebraic set \(V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\).

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) as input, which constructs a cylindrical algebraic decomposition \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying the frontier condition, and monotone with respect to each \(V_1, \ldots, V_k\).
This algorithm has complexity
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^n},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

Informally, an algorithm, which takes family of quantifier-free Boolean formulas representing some semialgebraic sets of dimension at most two as input and produces a cylindrical decomposition in which each of the input sets is a union of its cells.
This decomposition has the property that each cylindrical cell contained in one of the input sets is \emph{monotone} (see Definition \ref{def:monotone-cell}) and its closure is a union of cells in the decomposition. A complexity bound, only slightly higher than the ``classical'' CAD is obtained.

This algorithm follows the construction given in the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20, which proceeds in three stages.
First, a cylindrical cell decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compatible with each \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map. In Chapter \ref{sec:quasi-affine}, an algorithm, following \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19 is presented for the semialgebraic case. The following is proved.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm}{}\label{thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm}Let
\[
F_1,\ldots,F_k
\]
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas containing \(s\) different polynomials \(\mathbf{F} = \{ f_1,\ldots, f_s \} \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), having maximum degree \(d\), such that \(F_i, 1\le i \le k\) defines a bounded semialgebraic set \(V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\).

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) as input, which constructs an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), which is obviously compatible with each \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup \ldots\cup V_k\) is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.
This algorithm has complexity
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^n},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

Chapter 5 discusses, following the proofs of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 and Theorem 3.18, how the CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) produced by the algorithm from Theorem \ref{thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm} can be refined such that cells in the refinement are monotone with respect to each \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\). An algorithm for constructing this refinement, starting with the polynomials which have constant sign on cells of \(\mathcal{D}\), is presented.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm}{}\label{thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm}Let
\[
F_1,\ldots,F_k
\]
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas such that \(F_i, 1\le i \le k\) defines a bounded semialgebraic set \(V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\).
Let \(\mathbf{F} = \{f_1,\ldots,f_s\}\) be a set of polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) of maximum degree \(d\) and \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with each \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(\mathcal{D}\) as input, which produces a refinement \(\mathcal{D'}\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) monotone with respect to each \(V_1, \ldots, V_k\).
This algorithm has complexity
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^n},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

Finally, Chapter \ref{sec:frontier} describes how to complete the construction described in \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20, by refining the CAD such that it satisfies the frontier condition. Section \ref{sec:frontier-bgv} describes how the construction given in the last part of the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 can be applied to the CAD \(\mathcal{D'}\), produced by the algorithm from Theorem \ref{thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm} to produce a refinement \(\mathcal{D''}\) of \(\mathcal{D'}\) such that the closure of every cell of \(\mathcal{D'}\) contained in \(V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k\) is the union of some cells of \(\mathcal{D''}\).
In Section \ref{sec:lazard-3}, an algorithm, due to \citet{lazard10}, for constructing an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n, n \le 3\) satisfying the frontier condition and containing only topologically regular cells is presented. Section \ref{sec:lazard-n} explores how this method can be generalised to our situation. In order to do this, the results of \citet{lazard10}, Section 5.3 are generalised from \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to the two-dimensional cells in a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n, n > 3\).
The following is proved.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:lazard-rn}{}\label{thm:lazard-rn}Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a set of \(s\) polynomials with maximum degree \(d\).
Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) (\(\dim(V_i) \le 2 1\le i \le k\)).

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(\mathcal{D}\) as input, which produces a refinement \(\mathcal{D'}\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) of \(\mathcal{D'}\) satisfies the frontier condition.
This algorithm has complexity\ldots{}
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^n},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

All of these algorithms are presented as psuedo-code. Chapter \ref{sec:implementation-and-testing} discusses the implementation of this algorithm on top of Brown's QEPCAD \citep{brownQepcad} and presents some test cases.

The final contribution, in Chapter \ref{sec:novel-frontier}, is a novel algorithm for constructing a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compatible with a semialgebraic set of arbitrary dimansion and satisfying the frontier condition. This algorithm relies on a recursion on the lexicographical order of indices \((i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{ 0,1 \}^n\) associated with each cell in a cylindrical decomposition. The following is proved.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:main}{}\label{thm:main}Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F\) with \(s\) different polynomials of maximum degree \(d\) in \(\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(F\) as input, which outputs a cylindrical decomposition \(\mathcal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with \(S\) and
satisfying the frontier condition.
The complexity of this algorithm is \((sd)^{O(1)^{n2^n}}\).
This is also an upper bound on the number of cells in \(\mathcal D\), number of polynomials defining cells and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

Finally, Chapter \ref{sec:conclusions} discusses conclusions and further work.

\hypertarget{sets-definable-over-o-minimal-structures}{%
\subsection{Sets definable over O-minimal structures}\label{sets-definable-over-o-minimal-structures}}

We will be working mostly in the category \emph{Semialgebraic Set} and sometimes in the more general category of sets definable over an O-minimal structure.
A semialgebraic subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is the set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying a Boolean combination of polynomial equations and inequalities with coefficients in \(\mathbb{R}\).
A polynomial with coefficients in a field \(K\) and variables \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\) will be denoted as an element of \(K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:semialgebraic-set}{}\label{def:semialgebraic-set}

The semialgebraic subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) are the smallest class \({SA}_n\) of subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying the following properties.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(f \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), then \(\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}\) and \(\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}\) are elements of \({SA}_n\).
\item
  If \(A, B \in {SA}_n\), then \(A \cup B\), \(A \cap B\) and \(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus A\) are elements of \({SA}_n\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:graph-def-map}{}\label{def:graph-def-map}Let \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) and \(Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m\) be definable sets.
Let \(f : X \to Y\) be a mapping from \(X\) to \(Y\). The graph of \(f\) is the definable set
\[
\{ (\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x})) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+m} \mid \mathbf{x} \in X \}.
\]
Sometimes, the domain of \(f\) is \(\mathbb{R}^n\). In this case, we often use the restriction \(f\vert_X\) so that only images of \(f\) at points in \(X\) are considered,
The graph of \(f\) on \(X\) may be denoted by \(f(X)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) and \(Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m\). A mapping \(f : X \to Y\) is called semialgebraic if its graph (see Definition \ref{def:graph-def-map})
\[
\{ (\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x})) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+m} \mid \mathbf{x} \in X \}
\]
is a semialgebraic set.
\end{definition}

A semialgebraic set can be represented as a first-order Boolean formula with or without quantifiers. A first-order formula which does not contain quantifiers will be called a quantifier-free Boolean formula.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:qff}{}\label{def:qff}

A quantifier-free Boolean formula is obtained by the following rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(f \in \mathbb{R}[x_1\ldots,x_n]\) then \(f=0\) and \(f>0\) are quantifier-free Boolean formulas,
\item
  if \(F\) and \(G\) are quantifier-free Boolean formulas then \(F \land G\), \(F \lor G\) and \(\neg F\) are quantifier-free Boolean formulas.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:first-order-formula}{}\label{def:first-order-formula}

A first-order Boolean formula is obtained by rules 1 and 2 from Definition \ref{def:qff} and

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(F\) is a first-order Boolean formula and \(y\) is a variable ranging over \(\mathbb{R}\), then \(\exists y\ F\) and \(\forall y\ F\) are first-order Boolean formulas.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

Semialgebraic sets are closed under taking finite unions and intersections and the difference of two semialgebraic sets is semialgebraic.
A fundamental result in semialgebraic geometry is the Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem, which asserts that semialgebraic sets are also closed under taking projection.
The proof of Tarski's theorem was published in \citep{tarski1998}, whose release was delayed due to the war. It is very likely that Tarski actually proved the theorem much earlier, since Tarski mentioned this result in \citet{sierpinski1930}. The following statement of the theorem comes from \citep{vdd1988tarski}, but the theorem should obviously be attributed to Tarski.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:tarski-seinedberg}{}\label{thm:tarski-seinedberg}\citep{vdd1988tarski}
Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\) and \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}} : \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n\) be the projection map onto the first \(n\) co-ordinates. Then \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}}(S) \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is a semialgebraic set.
\end{theorem}

One important consequence of this theorem is that quantifier elimination is possible over real numbers. In other words, a subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) defined by a first-order formula with quantifiers is semialgebraic and can be represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula.
Since the closure of a semialgebraic set may be represented by a first-order Boolean formula with quantifiers, it follows from the Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem that the closure of a semialgebraic set is a semialgebraic set.

We present an algorithm for performing quantifier elimination over real numbers. This algorithm will be used to provide theoretical complexity bounds for solving quantifier elimination problems later.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:bpr-qe}{}\label{prp:bpr-qe}\citep[Algorithm 14.21]{bpr2006}

Let \(y_1 < \ldots < y_k < x_1 < \ldots < x_k\) be an ordered list of variables and \(K\) a real closed field. Define a first-order Boolean formula
\[
F := Q_1 (y_1,\ldots,y_{k_1}), Q_2 (y_{k_1 + 1},\ldots,y_{k_1 + k_2}) \ldots Q_\omega (y_{y_1 + \ldots + y_{\omega-1} + 1},\ldots, y_k) G
\]
where \(Q_i, 1\le i \le \omega\), is a quantifier \(\forall\) or \(\exists\), such that \(Q_i\) and \(Q_{i+1}\) are different and \(G\) is a quantifier-free Boolean formula containing \(s\) different polynomials of maximum degree \(d\) in \(K[y_1,\ldots,y_k,x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
Note that variables \(y_1,\ldots,y_k\) are partitioned into \(\omega\) ``blocks'' \(Y_1,\ldots,Y_\omega\) such that \(Y_i, 1 \le i \le \omega\) contains \(k_i\) variables, each of which is bound by the same quantifier \(Q_i\).
We say that the formula \(F\) contains \(\omega\) quantifier alternations.

Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by \(F\). There is a quantifier-free Boolean formula defining \(s\) of the form
\[
F' := \lor_{1 \le i \le I} \land_{1 \le j \le J_i} \left( \lor_{1 \le \ell \le L_{i,j}} f_{i,j,\ell}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \ast_{i,j,\ell} 0 \right)
\]
where each \(f_{i,j,n}\) is a polynomial in \(K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) and \(\ast_{i,j,\ell} \in \{<, =, >\}\) determines its sign.
Bounds on this formula are as follows

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(I \le s^{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \ldots (k_\omega + 1)(n+1)}d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}\),
\item
  \(J_i \le s^{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \ldots (k_\omega + 1)}d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}\),
\item
  \(L_{i,j} \le d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}\),
\item
  polynomials \(f_{i,j,\ell}\) have maximum degree \(d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}\).
\end{itemize}

There is an algorithm, taking \(F\) as input, which computes \(F'\) with complexity
\[
s^{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \ldots (k_\omega + 1)(n+1)}d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)O(n)}.
\]
\end{proposition}

In many quantifier elimination problems, there is only a small number of quantifier alternations and this algorithm gives a favourable complexity bound (better than, e.g., using CAD). For example, the formula for computing the closure of a semialgebraic set contains only two quantifier alternations, and this algorithm gives a complexity bound singly exponential in the number of variables (see Lemma \ref{lem:frontier}).

Another useful property of semialgebraic sets is that they admit a basic representation, as stated below.

Every semialgebraic subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is the (not necessarily disjoint) union of finitely many semialgebraic subsets of the kind
\[
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \cdots, g_k(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}
\]
where \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(f,g_1,\ldots,g_k \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
:::

This follows from the fact that the class of finite unions of this kind satisfy properties listed in Definition \ref{def:semialgebraic-set}.

We now define the O-minimal structures over the reals.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:definable-set}{}\label{def:definable-set}

A structure expanding the real closed field \(R\) is a collection \[
S := (S^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
\]
where each \(S^n\) is a set of subsets of the affine space \(R^n\) satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All algebraic subsets of \(R^n\) are in \(S^n\).
\item
  \(S^n\) is a Boolean subalgebra of the powerset of \(R^n\).
\item
  If \(A \in S^n\) and \(B \in S^m\), then \(A \times B \in S^{n+m}\).
\item
  Let \(\operatorname{proj}: R^{n+1} \to R^n\) be the projection onto the first \(n\) coordinates. If \(X\in R^{n+1}\), then \(\operatorname{proj}(X) \in R^n\).
\end{enumerate}

Elements of \(S^n\) (satisfying properties 1-4) are called the definable subsets of \(R^n\).
If the structure \(S\) satisfies properties 1-4 and the following property, it is called an O-minimal structure.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  The elements of \(S^1\) consist of the finite unions of points and open intervals of \(R\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:definable-function}{}\label{def:definable-function}A map \(f : A \to R^m\), where \(A \subset R^n\), is called \emph{definable} if its graph \(G \subset R^{n+m}\) is a definable set.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Since definable sets are closed under projection, it can be easily deduced that \(A\) is a definable set.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For convenience, we will call a definable map \(f : R^n \to R\) a definable function.
\end{remark}

It is easy to see that semialgebraic sets satisfy the properties of sets definable in an O-minimal structure over the reals. Another example is the sub-pfaffian sets.

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 2.1]{gv04}
A Pfaffian chain of order \(r \ge 0\) and degree \(\alpha \ge 1\) in an open domain \(G \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is a sequence of analytic functions
\[
f_1, \ldots , f_r
\]
in \(G\) satisfying the differential equations
\[
{df}_j(\mathbf{x}) = \sum^n_{i=1} g_{ij}(\mathbf{x}, f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_j(\mathbf{x})) dx_i
\]
for \(1 \le j \le r\), where \(g_{ij}(x_1,\ldots,x_n),y_1,\ldots,y_j)\) are polynomials of degree not greater than \(\alpha\).

A function \(f(\mathbf{x}) = P(\mathbf{x},f_1(\mathbf{x}),\ldots,f_r(\mathbf{x}))\), where \(P(\mathbf{x}, f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_r(\mathbf{x}))\) is a polynomial of degree not greater than \(\beta \ge 1\) is called a Pfaffian function of order \(r\) and degree \((\alpha, \beta)\). Note that \(f\) is only defined in the domain \(G\), where all functions \(f_1,\ldots,f_r\) are analytic, even if \(f\) itself can be extended as an analytic function in a larger domain.
\end{definition}

Examples of Pfaffian functions include the exponential, logarithmic, reciprocal and trigonometric functions, as well as the polynomials.

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 2.7]{gv04}
A set \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is called semi-Pfaffian in an open domain
\(G \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) if it consists of points in \(G\) satisfying a Boolean combination \(F\) of some atomic equations and inequalities \(f = 0\), \(g > 0\), where \(f, g\) are Pfaffian functions having a common Pfaffian chain defined in \(G\).

\(X\) is called restricted in \(G\) if \({\operatorname{cl} \left( X \right)}\) is contained in \(G\).

\(X\) is called basic if the Boolean combination \(F\) is a conjunction.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 2.8]{gv04}
A set \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is called sub-Pfaffian in an open domain \(G \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) if
\[
X := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}}(Y),
\]
where \(Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m\) is a semi-Pfaffian set and \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\citep[2.9]{gv04}
Let \({\cal I}^k := [-1,1]^k\) be the closed cube in an open domain \(G \subset \mathbb{R}^k\).
\(X \subset {\cal I}^n\) is called restricted sub-Pfaffian if \(X := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}}(Y)\), where \(Y \subset {\cal I}^{n+m}\) is a restricted semi-Pfaffian set.
\end{definition}

The restricted sub-pfaffian sets form a Boolean subalgebra. Restricted sub-pfaffian sets are clearly closed under taking finite unions and intersections. The property that the compliment of restricted sub-pfaffian set is restricted sub-pfaffian is a particular case of Gabrielov's compliment theorem \citep{gabrielov1996}. The restriction to the closed cube ensures that the restricted sub-Pfaffian sets are definable in an O-minimal structure. Furthermore, \citet{gv01} present an algorithm for constructing a cylindrical decomposition compatible with a restricted sub-Pfaffian set. Note that these properties and results may not be applied to (restricted) semi-Pfaffian sets. Since polynomials are a type of Pfaffian function, semialgebraic sets are a particular case of sub-Pfaffian sets and, due to the Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem, semialgebraics sets satisfy the compliment theorem.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:pfaff-format}{}\label{def:pfaff-format}\citep[Definition 2.11]{gv04}

\]
where \(f_{ij}\) and \(g_{ij}\) are Pfaffian functions of order \(r\) and degree \((\alpha, \beta)\) defined in an open domain \(G\)
The format of \(X\) is a tuple
\[
(r, N, \alpha, \beta, s)

where \(N \ge (I_1 + J_1) + \cdots + (I_M + J_M)\).

We now present, closely following \citet{bgv15}, some useful properties of definable sets. These properties can also be applied to semialgebraic sets, being a particular case of definable sets.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:affine-coordinate-subspace}{}\label{def:affine-coordinate-subspace}\citep[Definition 2.1]{bgv15}
Let \(L_{j,c} := \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mid x_j = c \}\) for some \(1 \le j \le n\) and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\).
Each intersection of the kind
\[
S := L_{j_1,c_1} \cap \ldots \cap L_{j_m,c_m}
\]
where \(0 \le j \le m\), \(1 \le j_1 < \cdots < j_m \le n\) and \(c_1,\ldots,c_m \in \mathbb{R}\) is called an affine coordinate subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

\(\mathbf{f}\) is called quasi-affine if, for any coordinate subspace \(L \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+k}\), the restriction \(\operatorname{proj}_{L}\vert_Y\) is injective if and only if \(\operatorname{proj}_{L}(Y)\) is \(n\)-dimensional.

We write \({\operatorname{span} \{x_{j_1},\ldots, x_{j_m}\}}\) to mean the
quotient space \(\mathbb{R}^n / W\).
Similarly, for any aﬃne coordinate subspace \(L \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) on which all the
functions \(x_j \in I\) are constant, we will identify \(L\) with its image under the canonical surjection
to \(\mathbb{R}^n / W\). We write \(\mathbb{R}^k\), where \(k \le n\), to mean \({\operatorname{span} \{x_1, \ldots, x_k \}}\).

\end{definition}

\hypertarget{cylindrical-algebraic-decomposition}{%
\section{Cylindrical algebraic decomposition}\label{cylindrical-algebraic-decomposition}}

We now give some background on Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD).
\citet{collins1975} introduced both the concept of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition along with an algorithm to construct a CAD, which is a finite partition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) into so-called Cylindrical Cells, such that each polynomial in \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) has a constant sign on every cylindrical cell in the decomposition.

Before describing Collins' algorithm, we will first define, closely following \citet{bgv15}, a cylindrical cell and cylindrical decomposition. Note that \citet{bgv15} work in the broader class of definable sets.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:cells}{}\label{def:cells}

Cylindrical cells are defined by induction on \(n\ge 1\). Each cylindrical cell \(C\) is a connected definable subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with an \emph{index}
\[
(i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{0,1\}^n.
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When \(n = 0\), there is a unique cylindrical cell \(\mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^0\).
\item
  When \(n = 1\), a \((0)\)-cell (section cell) is a point \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) and a \((1)\)-cell (sector cell) is an open interval: \((a,b)\), \((-\infty,b)\), \((a,\infty)\), \((-\infty,\infty)\) where \(a,b\in \mathbb{R}\).
\item
  When \(n > 1\), suppose that \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})\)-cells are already defined and let \(C'\) be one of these cells.
  An \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cell (section cell) is the graph of a continuous definable function \(f : C' \to \mathbb{R}\).
  An - \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\)-cell (sector cell) is a subset of the cylinder \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\), either
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  \{ (\mathbf{x},t) &\mid \mathbf{x} \in C', f(\mathbf{x}) < t < g(\mathbf{x})\},\\
  \{ (\mathbf{x},t) &\mid \mathbf{x} \in C', -\infty < t < g(\mathbf{x})\},\\
  \{ (\mathbf{x},t) &\mid \mathbf{x} \in C', f(\mathbf{x}) < t < \infty\},\\
  \{ (\mathbf{x},t) &\mid \mathbf{x} \in C', t \in \mathbb{R}\}
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  where \(f,g : C' \to \mathbb{R}\) are continuous definable functions such that \(f(\mathbf{x}) < g(\mathbf{x})\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\).
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a definable subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and define the \emph{frontier of \(S\)}
\[
{\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)} := {\operatorname{cl} \left( S \right)} \setminus S,
\]
where \({\operatorname{cl} \left( S \right)}\) is the closure of \(S\) in the Euclidean topology.
\end{definition}

If \(C \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is a cylindrical cell, then it will be convenient to partition \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) into three subsets: the top (\(C_T\)), bottom (\(C_B\)) and side-wall (\(C_W\)).

First let \(C\) be a sector \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\)-cell and let \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\). If \(C\) is bounded from below by a continuous function \(f : C' \to \mathbb{R}\), then \(C_B\) is the graph of \(f\). Similarly, if \(C\) is bounded from above by the graph of a continuous function \(g : C' \to \mathbb{R}\), then \(C_T\) is the graph of \(g\). It is clear that the top and bottom of every cylindrical sector cell (if non-empty) are always cylindrical section cells.

Now let \(C\) be an \((i_1,\ldots,i_{k},0,\ldots,0)\)-cell, where \(i_{k}=1\), and \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(C)\). Since \(C'\) is a sector cell, \(C'_B\) and \(C'_T\) are cylindrical section cells. The bottom \(C_B\) of \(C\) is the pre-image of \(C'_B\) by the projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}\vert_{{\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}}\) and the top \(C_T\) of \(C\) is the pre-image of \(C'_T\) by the projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}\vert_{{\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}}\).
It may be simpler to think of \(C_B\) as the definable set \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)} \cap (C'_B \times \mathbb{R}^{n - k + 1})\) and \(C_T\) as the definable set \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)} \cap (C'_T \times \mathbb{R}^{n - k + 1})\).
It is important to note that \(C_B\) and \(C_T\) may not be cylindrical cells. Indeed, they may fail to be graphs of continuous functions (see Definition \ref{def:blow-up-point} and Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}.

For both section and sector cells, let the side wall, \(C_W\), be \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} \setminus (C_B \cup C_T)\).
There is no requirement that \(C_W\) will be (a union of) cylindrical cells.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:blow-up-point}{}\label{def:blow-up-point}\citep[Definition 9.2]{bgv15}

Let \(\varphi : W \to \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function on a semialgebraic set \(W \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), and let \(\Phi \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\) be its graph.

A point \(\mathbf{x} \in \overline{W} \setminus W\) is called a blow-up point of \(\Phi\) if \[\operatorname{proj}^{-1}_{\mathbb{R}^n} (\mathbf{x}) \cap \overline{\Phi}\] contains an open interval.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The closure of the graph of a continuous definable function is the graph of a continuous definable function everywhere
except, possibly, over a subset of codimension at least \(2\) (see the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.14).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}{}\label{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), let \(C' := \{ -1 < x < 1, \vert x \vert < y < 1 \}\) and \(\phi(x,y) = \vert x / y \vert\) so that \(C\) is the graph of \(\phi\vert_{C'}\).
Consider \[
C_B := \{ -1 < x < 1, y = \vert x \vert, z = 1 \} \cup \{ (0,0,z) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \}.
\]
\(C_B\) is not the graph of a continuous function due to the blow-up point of \(\phi\) at the origin.
\end{example}

We now define the cylindrical decomposition.

\begin{definition}

A cylindrical decomposition is defined by induction on \(n \ge 0\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When \(n = 0\), the unique cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^0\) is the unique point in \(\mathbb{R}^0\).
\item
  When \(n > 0\): Let \(\cal D\) be a partition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) into cylindrical cells.
  Define \(\cal D'\) to be the set of all projections \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\) for all \(C\) in \(\cal D\).
  \(\cal D\) is a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) if \(\cal D'\) is a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). We call \(\cal D'\) the decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) induced by \(\cal D\).
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

Less formally, a partition \(\cal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) into definable subsets is cylindrical if the projection of any two cells of \(\cal D\) onto \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is either disjoint or coincides.

\begin{definition}
Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a definable set. A cylindrical decomposition \(\cal D\) is compatible with \(S\) if every cell \(C\) of \(\cal D\) is either a subset of \(S\) or disjoint from \(S\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A cylindrical decomposition \(\cal E\) is called a refinement of \(\cal D\) if \(\cal E\) is compatible with every cell of \(\cal D\). in other words, every cell of \(\cal D\) is a union of cells in the refinement \(\cal E\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\citep[Remark 3.8]{bgv15}
Let \(\cal D\) be a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(C\) be a cylindrical cell of \(\cal D\) such that \(c := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C)\) is a single point. Then it follows immediately from the definition that \(\cal D\) is compatible with the hyperplane \(\{ x_1 = c \}\) and the set of all cells of \(\cal D\) contained in this hyperplane form a cylindrical decomposition \(\cal E\) of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). Moreover, any refinement of \(\cal E\) is also a refinement of \(\cal D\).
\end{remark}

We now present some useful results proved by \citet{bgv15} relating to desirable properties of cylindrical decompositions.

\begin{definition}
Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a definable set. A cylindrical decomposition \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compatible with \(S\), is called monotone with respect to \(S\) if every cell \(C \subset S\) of \(\cal D\) is monotone.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:frontier-condition}{}\label{def:frontier-condition}Let \(\cal D\) be a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(C\) be a cell of \(\cal D\). \(C\) satisfies the frontier condition in \(\cal D\) is \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\cal D\) of smaller dimension. If it is unambiguous that \(C\) is a cell of \(\cal D\), then we just say that \(C\) satisfies the frontier condition.
If every cell in \(\cal D\) satisfies the frontier condition, then the cylindrical decomposition \(\cal D\) satisfies the frontier condition.
\end{definition}

We saw in Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical} that the top and bottom of a 2-dimensional cylindrical section cell, even in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), need not be a union of cylindrical cells.
However, it is clear from the cylindrical property that, if \(C\) is a 2-dimensional section cell satisfying the frontier condition in a decomposition \(\cal D\), then the top and bottom of \(C\) are single cylindrical cells.
If \(C\) is a 2-dimensional section cell, then it is said to satisfy the strong frontier condition if the one-dimensional components of its side-wall are 1-dimensional section cells. This condition may be impossible, even in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), as Example \ref{exm:side-wall} demonstrates.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:side-wall}{}\label{exm:side-wall}Consider the two cylindrical cells
\[
V := \{ x > y > 0, z > 0, y = xz \}
\] and \[
W := \{ x > y > 0, z > 0, y = 2xz \}
\] in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
Any cylindrical decomposition compatible with \(V\) and \(W\) is also compatible with the two intervals
\[
I_1 = \{ (0,0,z) \mid 0 \le z \le 1/2 \}, I_2 = \{ (0,0,z) \mid 1/2 \le z \le 1 \}
\]
and the point \[v = (0,0,1/2).\]
Observe that \(I = \{ (0,0,z) \mid 0 \le z \le 1 \}\) is the only one-dimensional component of the side-wall of \(V\) and \(I_1\) is the only one-dimensional component of the side-wall of \(W\). In order to obtain the strong frontier condition, we need to partition \(V\) into (at least) three cylindrical cells \(V',V'',V'''\), one of which, say \(V''\), will be one-dimensional. \(V''\) should have endpoint \(v\) (i.e., \({\operatorname{cl} \left( V'' \right)} \cap I = v\)).
The tangent at the origin of \(c := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}}(V'')\) is \(1/2\). The pre-image of the projection map \(W' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}}^-1\vert_{{\operatorname{cl} \left( W \right)}}(c)\) would satisfy the condition \({\operatorname{cl} \left( W' \right)} \cap I = v'\), where \(v' = (0,0,1/4)\). However, \(v'\) must be a zero-dimensional cell of the decomposition, which means we need to perform another refinement of \(I\). An infinite sequence of refinements, introducing a new 0-dimensional cell \((0,0,1/2^k), k \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}\), will take place. Thus, a decomposition in in which the side-walls of \(V\) and \(W\) are single 1-dimensional cells cannot exist.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:delete-zero-index}{}\label{prp:delete-zero-index}\citep[Lemma 3.3]{bgv15}
Let \(C\) be an \((i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1},0,i_{k+1},\ldots,i_n)\)-cell. Then \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1},x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n\}}}}(C)\) is a cylindrical \((i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1},i_{k+1},\ldots,i_n)\)-cell and \(C\) is the graph of a monotone map \(f : C' \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_k\}}\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
\citep[Lemma 3.4]{bgv15}
Let \(C \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a 2-dimensional cylindrical cell which is the graph of a quasi-affine map. Then the side-wall \(W \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) has exactly two connected components, each of which is either a point or a closed curve interval.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
It was proved by \citet{pianomovers1983} that a cylindrical decomposition, compatible with a semialgebraic set and satisfying the frontier condition, can be obtained following a linear rotation of coordinates.
\citet{jhd20} prove that a cylindrical decomposition having constant sign on a set of input polynomials will contain topologically regular cells and satisfy the frontier condition, regardless of the method used to construct it, as long as the input polynomials do not blow up anywhere.
Proposition \ref{prp:monotone-topologically-regular} (\citet{bgv13}, Theorem 1) asserts that every monotone cell is topologically regular, so \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 describes the construction of a CAD, compatible with a family \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) of definable subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), each having dimension at most \(2\), in the potential presence of blow-up points and without the need to make a change of coordinates.
\end{remark}

\hypertarget{sec:cad-construction}{%
\subsection{Constructing a CAD}\label{sec:cad-construction}}

\begin{remark}
A cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a cylindrical decomposition in which every cell is a semialgebraic set. While the results of \citet{bgv15} are proved for the wider class of cylindrical decompositions compatible with definable sets, we will restrict ourselves to CADs, allowing us to take advantage of properties of polynomials.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Let \(\mathbf{F} := (f_1,\ldots,f_s) \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a set of polynomials with integer coefficients. A cylindrical algebraic decomposition \(\cal D\) is called sign-invariant with respect to \(\mathbf{F}\) (or simply \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant) if each polynomial \(f \in \mathbf{F}\) has a constant sign (either \(< 0\), \(= 0\) or \(> 0\)) on every cylindrical cell \(C\) of \(\mathcal{D}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that for the coefficients of \(\mathbf{F}\), we may choose any ring \(K \subset \mathbb{R}\). \(\mathbb{Z}\) has been chosen for convenience, but some authors (e.g., \citet{pianomovers1983}) choose \(\mathbb{Q}\) instead. It is also common to take polynomials with coefficients over \(\mathbb{R}\). However, the choice has been made to avoid this so as to work over the algebraic numbers \(\mathcal{A}\), whose elements are easily represented in, and manipulated by, computers.
\end{remark}

Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a set of polynomials with integer coefficients. We will now describe the algorithm proposed by \citet{collins1975}, closely following \citet{coste2000}, for constructing an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

Collins' algorithm uses the idea of projection and lifting. More precisely, successive projections of the set of input polynomials to smaller and smaller dimensions are taken, until a set of univariate polynomials is obtained. The CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^1\) is constructed by isolating the roots of these univariate polynomials, with section cells being the roots and sector cells being the open intervals in between them. The lifting phase then works recursively: given a collection of cells in \(\mathbb{R}^k\) and a set of polynomials in \(\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\), the roots of these polynomials within each cell \(C\) are isolated. The section cells in the cylinder \(C \times \mathbb{R}\) are the roots of these polynomials, while the sector cells are the bands in between the roots. The projection operation was designed such that the cylindrical property holds. I.e., above \(C\), each polynomial has a constant number of roots and the roots of no two polynomials ``cross over'' each other.
The second property is called delineability.

Let us begin the description of the algorithm by considering a single polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
We want to partition \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) into connected semialgebraic sets \(C'\) such that, for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\), \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) has constant degree and a constant number of roots.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:coste-polynomial-to-cell}{}\label{prp:coste-polynomial-to-cell}\citep[Proposition 2.16]{coste2000}
Let \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) and, \(C' \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) be a connected semialgebraic set and \(k \le d \in \mathbb{N}\) such that, for every point \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\), the univariate polynomial \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n) \in \mathbb{A}[x_n]\) has degree \(d\) and exactly \(k\) distinct (complex) roots in \(C'\).
Then there are \(\ell \le k\) distinct semialgebraic functions
\[\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_\ell : C' \to \mathbb{R}
\]
such that, for every \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\), the set of real roots of \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) is exactly
\[\{ \psi_1(\mathbf{x}, \ldots, \psi_\ell(\mathbf{x}) \}.\]
Moreover, the multiplicity of each of these roots is constant.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The argument relies on the ``continuity of roots'':

\begin{quote}
Fix \(\mathbf{c} \in C'\) and let \(z_1,\ldots,z_k\) be the distinct roots of \(f(\mathbf{c},x_n)\) with multiplicities \(m_1,\ldots,m_k\).
Choose \(\varepsilon > 0\) small enough that the open discs \(D(z_i,\varepsilon) z_i \in \mathbb{C}\) (center \(z_i\), radius \(\varepsilon\)) are disjoint. If \(\mathbf{b} \in C'\) is sufficiently close to \(\mathbf{c}\), then the polynomial \(f(\mathbf{b}, x_n)\) has exactly \(m_i\) roots, counted with multiplicities, in \(D(z_i,\varepsilon)\) for \(1\le i \le k\).
\end{quote}

Since \(f(\mathbf{b},x_n)\) has \(k\) distinct complex roots, and \(d = m_1+ \ldots + m_k\) complex roots counted with multiplicities, it follows that each \(D(z_i,\varepsilon)\) contains exactly one root, denoted \(\zeta_i\), of \(f(\mathbf{b},x_n)\) with multiplicity \(m_i\).
If \(z_i\) is real, then \(\zeta_i\) is real, otherwise the complex conjugate of \(\zeta_i\) would be another root of \(f(\mathbf{b},x_n)\) in the disc \(D(z_i,\varepsilon)\).
If \(z_i\) is complex then \(\zeta_i\) is also complex, since the conjugation of every point in \(D(z_i, \varepsilon)\) lies outside \(D(z_i, \varepsilon)\), forming another disc \(D(\overline{z_i}, \varepsilon)\).
It follows that, if \(\mathbf{b} \in C'\) is close enough to \(\mathbf{c}\), then \(f(\mathbf{c},x_n)\) has the same number of real roots as \(f(\mathbf{b},x_n)\). Since \(C'\) is connected, \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) has the same number of real roots at every point \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\), say \(\ell\).
Define \(\psi_i(\mathbf{x}) : C' \to \mathbb{R}\) to be the continuous (by making \(\varepsilon\) small enough) semialgebraic function sending \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\) to the \(i\)-th (in ascending order) real root of \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\). It follows from the connectedness of \(C'\) that each \(\psi_i\) has constant multiplicity.
Observe that the graph of each \(\psi_i\) can be expressed by a first-order Boolean formula, using existential quantifiers to express each of the \(\ell\) roots of \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) and an equality condition to pick out the \(i\)-th root.
It follows that the graph of each functin \(\psi_i\) is a semialgebraic set.
\end{proof}

To extend this result to more than one polynomial, we also need to ensure that the graphs corresponding to each root never intersect.

\begin{proposition}
\citep[Proposition 2.18]{coste2000}
Let \(f,g \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), \(C' \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) such that, for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\), the degree and number of roots of \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) and \(g(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) is constant and the degree of the GCD of \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) and \(g(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) is constant.
Let \(\phi,\psi : C' \to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous semialgebraic functions such that \(f(\mathbf{x},\phi(\mathbf{x})) = 0\) and \(g(\mathbf{x},\psi(\mathbf{x})) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} in C'\).
If there exists \(\mathbf{c} \in C'\) such that \(\phi(\mathbf{c}) = \psi(\mathbf{c})\), then \(\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \psi(\mathbf{x})\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We use the same method of proof as in the previous proposition.
For an arbitrary element \(\mathbf{c} \in C'\), let \(z_1 = \phi(\mathbf{c}) = \psi(\mathbf{c}), \ldots, z_k\) be the distinct roots in \(\mathbb{C}\) of the product
\[
f(\mathbf{c},x_n) g(\mathbf{c},x_n)
\]
(recall that \(fg = 0\) if either \(f=0\) or \(g=0\)).
Let \(m_i\) (resp \(p_i\)) be the multiplicity of \(z_i\) as a root of \(f(\mathbf{x},x_n)\) (resp. \(g(\mathbf{x}, x_n)\)) where multiplicity zero indicates that \(z_i\) is not a root.
The degree of \(\gcd(f(\mathbf{x}, x_n), g(\mathbf{x}, x_n))\) is \(\min(m_1,p_1) + \cdots + \min(m_k,p_k)\) and each \(z_i\) has multiplicity \(\min(m_i,p_i)\) as a root of this GCD.
Choose \(\varepsilon > 0\) small enough that the discs \(D(z_i,\varepsilon)\) are disjoint.
For each \(\mathbf{b} \in C'\) close enough to \(\mathbf{c}\), each disc contains a root of multiplicity \(m_i\) of \(f(\mathbf{b}, x_n)\) and a root of multiplicity \(p_i\) of \(g(\mathbf{b}, x_n)\). Since the degree of the GCD of \(f\) and \(g\) (evaluated at any \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\)) is equal to \(\min(m_1,p_1) + \cdots + \min(m_k,p_k)\), this GCD must have one root of multiplicity \(\min(m_i,p_i)\) in each disc \(D(z_i,\varepsilon)\) such that \(\min(m_i,p_i) > 0\).
In particular, it follows that \(\phi(\mathbf{b}) = \psi(\mathbf{b})\). Since \(C'\) is connected, this equality holds for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\).
\end{proof}

Now we have algebraic conditions on the polynomials in the set of level-\((n-1)\) projection polynomials \(\mathbf{F}' = \operatorname{proj}(\mathbf{F})\). We now describe how these properties can be satisfied and, as such, how the set \(\mathbf{F}'\) can be constructed. We will need the concept of the principal subresultant coefficient of two polynomials \(f\) and \(g\).

\begin{definition}
Let \(f,g \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]\) be polynomials, with degrees \(d\) and \(e\) respectively, such that
\begin{align*}
f(x_n) &= a_d x_n^d + \cdots + a_1 x_n + a_0 \\
g(x_n) &= b_e x_n^e + \cdots + b_1 x_n + b_0. \\
\end{align*}
Then the Sylvester matrix associated to \(f\) and \(g\) is the \((d + e) \times (d + e)\)-matrix defined as follows.
\[
S_{f,g}(f,g) =
\begin{pmatrix}a_{d} & \ldots & a_{0} & 0 & \ldots & \ldots & 0\\
0 & a_{d} & \ldots & a_{0} & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
\ldots & 0 & a_{d} & \ldots & a_{0} & \ldots & 0\\
b_{e} & \ldots & b_{0} & 0 & \ldots & \ldots & 0\\
0 & b_{e} & \ldots & b_{0} & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
\ldots & 0 & b_{e} & \ldots & b_{0} & \ldots & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let \(f,g \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]\) be polynomials with degrees \(d\) and \(e\) respectively. The principal subresultant coefficient of order \(j\) of \(f\) and \(g\), denoted \(\operatorname{psrc}_j(f,g)\), is the determinant of the \((m + n - 2j) \times (m + n - 2j)\)-matrix obtained from the Sylvester matrix associated to \(f\) and \(g\) by deleting the first and last \(j\) rows and columns.
\end{definition}

Let \(f,g \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]\) and \(X \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(f\) has a constant number of complex roots over \(X\) if
  \[
  \operatorname{psrc}_k(f, \partial f / \partial x_n),
  \]
  for \(1 \le k \le \deg(f)\), is either zero or nonzero everywhere in \(X\).
\item
  \(f\) and \(g\) have constant GCD in \(X\) if
  \[
  \operatorname{psrc}_k(f, g),
  \]
  for \(1 \le k \le \min(\deg(f),\deg(g))\), is either zero or nonzero and \(\deg(f) = \deg(g)\) everywhere in \(X\).
\item
  If, for the leading term of \(f\) (or \(g\)) vanishes at some points in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]\), we need to take the principal subresultant coefficients of the reductum of \(f\) (or \(g\)).
  \citep[pp36]{coste2000}
\end{itemize}

From these properties of the principal subresultant coefficient, we can define a projection operator.

\begin{definition}

Consider \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) as a univariate polynomial in \(x_n\). I.e.,
\[
f(x_n) = a_d x_n^d + \cdots + a_1 x_n + a_0
\]
where \(a_d,\ldots,a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]\).
Let \(\operatorname{lc}{f} = a_d\) denote the leading coefficient of \(f\) and \(\operatorname{red}(f) = a_{d-1}x_n^{d-1} + \cdots + a_1 x_n^1 + a_0\) be the reductum of \(f\).

Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\). We define the projection operator, \(\operatorname{proj}(\mathbf{F})\) as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Let \(d := \deg(f_i)\). If \(d > 1\), then \(\operatorname{proj}(f_1,\ldots,f_i,\ldots,f_s)\) contains
  \[
  \operatorname{psrc}_k(f_i, \partial f_i / \partial x_n)
  \]
  for all \(1\le k \le d\).
\item
  Let \(d := \min(\deg(f_i), \deg(f_j))\). If \(d > 0\), then \(\operatorname{proj}(f_1,\ldots,f_i,\ldots,f_j,\ldots,f_s)\) contains
  \[
  \operatorname{psrc}_k(f_i, f_j)
  \]
  for all \(1 \le k \le d\).
\item
  If \(\deg(f_i) > 0\) and \(\operatorname{lc}(f_i)\) is non-constant, then \(\operatorname{proj}(f_1,\ldots,f_i,\ldots,f_s)\) contains
  \[
  \operatorname{lc}(f_i) \text{ and } \operatorname{proj}(f_1,\ldots,\operatorname{red}(f_i),\ldots,f_n).
  \]
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:cad-lift}{}\label{thm:cad-lift}\citep[Theorem 2.19]{coste2000}
Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a family of polynomials and let \(C'\) be a connected \(\operatorname{proj}(\mathbf{F})\)-invariant semialgebraic subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) -- an \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})\)-cell.
Then there exist continuous definable functions
\[
\psi_1,\ldots, psi_\ell : C' \to \mathbb{R}
\]
such that for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\), the set \(\{ \psi_i(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \psi_k(\mathbf{x}) \}\) coincides with the real roots of polynomials in \(\mathbf{F}\), defining the \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cells in the cylinder \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\) and \(\{ -\infty < t < \psi_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \psi_i(\mathbf{x}) < t < \psi_{i+1}(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \psi_k(\mathbf{x}) < t < \infty \}\) are the \((i_1,\ldots, i_{n-1},1)\)-cells in the cylinder \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\).
\end{theorem}

This follows from the results previously proved. Applying Theorem \ref{thm:cad-lift}, we are able to pass from a \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(\mathbf{F})\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\) to a \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(\mathbf{F})\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^k\). Thus, by iterating the projection operation until we obtain a set of polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1]\), isolating their roots, and then iteratively applying Theorem \ref{thm:cad-lift}\$, we are able to obtain an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

\hypertarget{bounds-and-variations}{%
\subsection{Bounds and variations}\label{bounds-and-variations}}

We have described how to construct a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) which is sign-invariant with respect to a set of polynomials. We now
present the bounds, along with some variations, from \citet{bpr2006}.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:collins}{}\label{prp:collins}\citep[Algorithm 11.2]{bpr2006}
Let \(\mathbf{F} := f_1,\ldots,f_s\) be set of polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots ,x_n]\) with maximum degree \(d\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(\mathbf{F}\) as input, which produces an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD \(\cal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
The complexity of the algorithm is
\[(sd)^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]
This is also an upper bound on the number of cells in \(\cal D\), number of polynomials defining cells and their degrees.
\end{proposition}

Observe that these bounds are doubly exponential in the number of variables. It is not possible to improve upon this doubly exponential bound.
Indeed, \citet{davenportHeintz1988} give an example of a CAD in which a doubly exponential number of cells is obtained. In practice, we can obtain a CAD with fewer cells, e.g., by constructing a truth invariant or partial CAD.

\begin{corollary}
\protect\hypertarget{cor:collins-sets}{}\label{cor:collins-sets}Let \(S_1,\ldots,S_k\) be a finite collection of semialgebraic subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) defined by quantifier-free Boolean formulas \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) respectively. Together, these formulas include \(s\) different polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) with maximum degree \(d\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(\{F_1,\ldots,F_k\}\) as input, which produces a cylindrical decomposition \(\mathcal E\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with each set \(S_i, 1 \le i \le k\).
Complexity, number of cells, number of polynomials and degrees are the same as in Proposition \ref{prp:collins} but, in practice, more efficient algorithms exist (see e.g., \citet{collins1991} and \citet{bradford2014}).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This construction follows immediately from Proposition \ref{prp:collins}, where truth values of \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) associated to each cell.
The complexity upper bound (and bounds on number of cell, polynomials and degrees) is the same as in Proposition \ref{prp:collins}.
\end{proof}

It is also common to construct a CAD compatible with a single semialgebraic set.

\begin{corollary}
\protect\hypertarget{cor:collins-set}{}\label{cor:collins-set}Let \(S\subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F\) containing \(s\) different polynomials in \(\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), having maximum degree \(d\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(F\) as input, which produces a cylindrical decomposition \(\mathcal E\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with \(S\).
Complexity, number of cells, number of polynomials and degrees are the same as in Proposition \ref{prp:collins}.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Immediate, by applying Corollary \ref{cor:collins-set} to \(\{ F \}\).
\end{proof}

The construction described in Corollary \ref{cor:collins-sets} is somewhat naive.
Constructions which are far more efficient in practice are presented in e.g., \citet{collins1991}. An alternative approach is presented by \citet{bradford2014}.
While very useful in practice, these constructions are unable to lower the upper bound from Proposition \ref{prp:collins} due to some extreme cases, e.g., when the input formulas define a sign-invariant CAD (see \citet{bradford2014}, Section 6.2.1{]}.

\hypertarget{the-projection-operator}{%
\subsection{The projection operator}\label{the-projection-operator}}

Since Collins published his CAD algorithm in 1975, many variations of the projection operator have been proposed. Most of these aim to minimise the number of polynomials appearing in \(\operatorname{proj}_{k-1}(\mathbf{F})\), so as to make the algorithm more efficient in practice.
For example, \citet{collins1975} observed that, in dimension \(2\), if the set \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2]\) of input polynomials is
squarefree and pairwise relatively prime, then it is sufficient to include only the leading
coefficients, resultants and discriminants of pairs of polynomials in \(\operatorname{proj}(\mathbf{F})\). \citet{mccallum1988} then proved that a
similar construction is possible in dimension \(3\).
\citet{mccallum1998} later improved upon his previous work by extending this result to dimension \(n > 3\), as long as the set of input polynomials is well oriented.

\begin{definition}

\citep[6.1]{mccallum1998}
Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\) be a set of polynomials and denote by \(\operatorname{prim}(\mathbf{F})\) the set of all primitive parts of \(\mathbf{F}\)
\(\mathbf{F}\) is called well-oriented if, when \(n > 1\),

\begin{itemize}
\item
  for each element \(f \in \operatorname{prim}(A)\), \(f(\mathbf{x},y) = 0\) for all \(y\in \mathbb{R}\) on a finite number of points \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). \citep[condition WO1]{mccallum1998}
\item
  \(\operatorname{proj}(\mathbf{F})\) is well-oriented. \citep[condition WO2]{mccallum1998}
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\citet{brown2001} then observed that even more polynomials can be discarded, creating the Reduced McCallum Projection Operator. This is commonly used in practice, e.g., in \texttt{QEPCAD-B} \citep{brownQepcad}.

Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a well-oriented set of polynomials and \(\cal D\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD constructed using the McCallum projection operator \citep{mccallum1998}. Then, by \citet{mccallum1988} Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, every cell \(C\) of \(\cal D\) is an analytic submanifold of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Informally, if \(\dim(C) = k\), thent \(C\) is a non-empty subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) which ``looks locally like \(\mathbb{R}^k\)'' (see Definition \ref{def:analytic-submanifold} for the precise definition).

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:analytic-submanifold}{}\label{def:analytic-submanifold}\(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(S) = k\) is an analytic submanifold if, for every point \(\mathbf{x} \in S\), there is an analytic coordinate system about \(\mathbf{x}\) with respect to which \(S\) is locally the intersection of \(n-k\) coordinate hyperplanes.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:mc-smooth}{}\label{prp:mc-smooth}Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula constructed from the set of polynomials \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), such that \(\mathbf{F}\) is well-oriented.
Then a CAD \(\cal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with \(S\) and such that every cell \(C\) of \(\cal D\) is an analytic submanifold of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) can be obtained by constructing an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) using the McCallum projection operator.
\end{proposition}

More recently, \citet{mccallum2019} completed the proof that Lazard's projection operator is valid. McCallum also proved, without the condition on well-orientedness of input polynomials, that every cell of a sign-invariant CAD constructed using Lazard's projection operator is an analytic submanifold. Thus, we can generalise Proposition \ref{prp:mc-smooth} further:

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:lz-smooth}{}\label{prp:lz-smooth}Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula constructed from the set of polynomials \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
Then a CAD \(\cal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with \(S\) and such that every cell \(C\) of \(\cal D\) is an analytic submanifold of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) can be obtained by constructing an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) using the McCallum projection operator.
\end{proposition}

\hypertarget{projection-polynomials-vs-semialgebraic-functions}{%
\subsection{Projection polynomials vs semialgebraic functions}\label{projection-polynomials-vs-semialgebraic-functions}}

Recall that Proposition \ref{prp:coste-polynomial-to-cell} allows us to pass from a projection polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k]\) to the continuous semialgebraic functions \(\phi : C' \to \mathbb{R}\), where \(C' \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is a cylindrical cell, from Definition \ref{def:cells} which define some of the section cells in the cylinder \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\). The construction described in \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 (and related lemmas) works with these continuous semialgebraic functions. However, we are given only the projection polynomials \(f\) of which \(\phi\) defines one of the roots.

Let \(C\) be a section cell in \(\mathbb{R}^n\): a semialgebraic set which is the graph of a continuous semialgebraic function \(\phi : C' \to \mathbb{R}\), where \(C' \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is a cylindrical cell. A simple example in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) demonstrates that, although \(C\) is a semialgebraic set, \(\phi\) may not be a polynomial. Indeed, let
\[ C := \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x > 0, y > 0, y = x^2 \} \]
be a cylindrical cell in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) such that \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}\mid x > 0 \}\). We can write
\[
\phi(x) = +\sqrt{x}
\]
such that \(C\) is the graph of \(\phi\vert_{C'}\). However, it's clear that \(\phi\) is not a polynomial.

In computations, we work exclusively with section cells. When dealing with sector cells, we will consider the graphs of functions defining their top and bottom.
Since we will be using \texttt{SACLIB} and sometimes \texttt{Singular}, which are polynomial libraries, we will not be able to use the functions \(\phi\) in computations. We will instead use a different representation for a section cell \(C\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Let \(C\) be the root of a polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) and \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\) satisfy the conditions in Proposition \ref{prp:coste-polynomial-to-cell}. Then
\[
C \subset Z := \{ (\mathbf{x},x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \mathbf{x} \in C', f(\mathbf{x},x_n) = 0 \} \subset C' \times \mathbb{R}.
\]
In particular, \(Z\) consists of the roots of \(f\) in the cylinder \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\), which includes the section cell \(C\). It is
clear from the Tarski--Seidenberg theorem that it is possible to represent \(C\) as a first-order Boolean formula. In practice, since \(C\) is the root of a polynomial, we may define it using Thom's Lemma \citep{costeRoyThomLemma}. I.e., a root of a polynomial may be defined by sign conditions on its derivatives. Thus, let
\[
C = \{ (\mathbf{x},x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \mathbf{x} \in C', f(\mathbf{x},x_n) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x},x_n) > 0, \ldots, g_k(\mathbf{x},x_n) > 0 \}
\]
where \(g_1,\ldots,g_k\) are derivatives of the polynomial \(f\).

\hypertarget{sec:cell-formula}{%
\subsection{CAD cells and their defining formulas}\label{sec:cell-formula}}

Although it is possible to construct a ``full'' (sign-invariant) CAD, \texttt{QEPCAD-B} provides an implementation of the ``truth-invariant'' CAD described in Corollary \ref{cor:collins-sets}. Indeed, QEPCAD-B, being designed primarily to perform quantifier elimination, frequently constructs a ``partial'' CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) \citep{brownQepcad}.
We will force the construction of the sign-invariant CAD and use McCallum's projection operator so as to obtain smooth cells (see Proosition \ref{prp:mc-smooth}).

Once constructed, one may want to examine individual cells of the CAD.
In order to do this, we will need a convenient representation for each cell.
Depending on the purpose for which the CAD has been constructed, a particular representation may be chosen. For example, if we only need a witness, i.e., some point in the cell, only the sample points are needed. Indeed, this is a common requirement and Maple's \texttt{RegularChains::CylindricalAlgebraicDecompose} function provides output in this representation \citep{chen2014}.
On the other hand, one might want to view each cell as a semialgebraic set. In this case, a defining formula will be necessary.
Such a representation using only the input and projection polynomials may be impossible and, as such, an ``extended language'' has been introduced in both Maple and \texttt{QEPCAD} \citep[\citet{brownQepcad}]{chen2014}. The extended language includes the rules of first-order Boolean formulas (see Definition \ref{def:qff}) along with a means of representing ``the \(i\)-th root of polynomial \(f\)''. We find this representation a little inconvenient and would prefer each cell to be representable by an ordinary first-order Boolean formula.

To see how the signs of projection factors may be insufficient to represent a cylindrical cell, consider the following simple example in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
Let \(f = x - y^2\) and construct an \(\{f\}\)-invariant CAD. The projection polynomials
\[
P = \{ x, x - y^2 \}.
\]
The two distinct cells \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) have signs \(x > 0, x - y^2 = 0\). By Thom's Lemma, it is possible to represent these cells by sign conditions on derivatives of \(f\).
In this example, it is clear that another polynomial, \(y\), is needed to distinguish between these cells. \citet{brown99} proposed an algorithm for constructing a solution formula if the projection polynomials are not sufficient. The basic idea is that ``conflicting pairs'', distinct cells having the same signature (signs of projection factors), are identified, then additional derivatives of projection factors are added so that the conflicting pairs can be distinguished.

The algorithm proposed by \citet{brown99} is implemented as the ``solution formula construction phase'' in QEPCAD. A small modification has been made such that this algorithm may be used to construct formulas for individual cells as opposed to the set of points satisfying the input formula. More precisely, the definition of a conflicting pair was slightly modified.

\begin{definition}
Let \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) be distinct cells in a CAD \(\cal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Each cell \(C\) is assigned a truth value \(T_C \in \{\tt{True}, \tt{False}, \tt{undet}\}\) and a list \(S_C = (S_1,\ldots,S_k)\) where \(S_i = (s_{i,1},\ldots,s_{i,s_i}, 1\le i \le k\) is the list of signs of level-\(i\) (factorised) projection polynomials \(f_1,\ldots,f_{i_s} \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_i]\), with \(s_{i,j} \in \{-1,0,1\}\).
\((C_1, C_2)\) is called a conflicting pair in \(\cal D\) if \(T_{C_1}, T_{C_2} \in \{\tt{True}, \tt{False}\}\) and \(T_{C_1} = T_{C_2}\) and \(S_{C_1} = S_{C_2}\) (equality determined component-wise).
\end{definition}

For our purposes, the condition on truth values being equal has been dropped so that every cell in the CAD may be distinguished by the signs of its projection polynomials only. In all other aspects, Brown's solution formula construction algorithm may be applied unchanged. In order to represent a cell by a quantifier-free Booleean formula, it may be necessary to split a cell into several disjoint semialgebraic sets. Thus, each cell will be represented in disjunctive normal form, where each literal is a sign condition on a projection polynomial or one of its derivatives.

\chapter{Smooth Stratification}\label{sec:smooth-strat}}

Before turning our attention to cylindrical decompositions, we will present another useful algorithm for decomposing a semialgebraic set.
A smooth stratification is a finite partition of a set into smooth manifolds.
This algorithm will form part of the later work in constructing a CAD with monotone cells, which requires the input sets to first be partitioned into smooth smooth manifolds (see Section \ref{sec:quasi-affine}. However, the algorithm and implementation described in this section are useful in their own right.

In 1957, \citet{whitney1992} proved that every algebraic variety can be partitioned into a finite set of smooth manifolds, each of which is a semialgebraic set.
Lojasiewicz extended this result by proving that every real semianalytic set admits a smooth stratification, such that every stratum is a semianalytic set \citep{lojasiewicz1964}. However, the proof was non-constructive and did not provide any information on the class of functions defining the strata.
As part of his Complement Theorem, \citet{gabrielov1996} proved that the strata of a semianalytic set can be defined by functions belonging to the smallest extensions of a family of functions defining the set which is closed under addition, multiplication and taking partial derivatives. One such class of functions is the Pfaffian functions.
\citet{gv1995} present an algorithm for computing a smooth stratification of a semi-pfaffian set, along with an estimate of its complexity and bounds on the formats of the strata it produces. This algorithm (also summarised in \citet{gv04}, Section 6) will be presented.

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 6.2]{gv04}
A weak stratification of a semi-Pfaffian set \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is a partition of \(X\) into a finite number of non-singular manifolds \(X_k, 0 \le k \le n\) called strata. Strata need not be connected (or even have a finite number of connected components) and may be empty.

The stratification is called basic if all strata are basic semi-Pfaffian sets which are effectively nonsingular.
I.e., the system of equations and inequalities defining each stratum \(X_k\) of codimension \(k\) includes a set of \(k\) Pfaffian functions
\[
h_{i_1}, \ldots , h_{i_k}
\] such that the restriction \(h_{i_j}\vert_{X_i} = 0\) and \(d h_{i_j} \ne 0\) at every point \(\mathbf{x} \in X_k\), for each \(1 \le j \le k\).
\end{definition}

Note that this definition does not guarantee any other desirable properties of the manifolds \(X_k\). E.g., the closure of a stratum may not be a union of strata.

\section{Description of the algorithm}\label{sec:strat-alg-description}}

Since every semialgebraic set is a semi-Pfaffian set, this algorithm can be applied to the semialgebraic sets with almost no modifications.
Since each stratum is defined by sign conditions on partial derivatives of input functions, it is clear that if the input set is semialgebraic, then each stratum will be semialgebraic, too. Furthermore, as emptiness of semialgebraic sets can be decided, e.g., using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition algorithm, an Oracle will not be needed in this variation of the algorithm.
The algorithm relies on computing partial derivatives of the functions defining the input set. In the semi-Pfaffian case, the number of partial derivatives which must be considered is bounded by the format of the input set. As every polynomial has a finite number of partial derivatives, the bound for the semialgebraic case will simply be the degree of the polynomial.

We will need the following notation for partial derivatives and the partial differential operator defined by \citet{gv1995}.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:pdo}{}\label{def:pdo}\citep[Definition 2]{gv1995}
Let \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a polynomial and let \((m_1,\ldots,m_n) \subset \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^n\) be a multi-index associated to one of its partial derivatives.
I.e., we write
\[
\partial f^{(m_1,\ldots,m_n)} =
\dfrac{\partial^{m_1} f}{\partial x_1} \cdots \dfrac{\partial^{m_n} f}{\partial x_n}.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 2]{gv1995}
We define the partial differential operator \(\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j} f\) (where the argument \(f\) is a polynomial) as the determinant
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
 & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
We write \(\partial^m_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j}\) to mean the \(m\)-th iteration of \(\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j}\).
\end{definition}

We can now present the algorithm from \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:strat}{}\label{thm:strat}Let
\[
X := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1 = 0, \ldots, f_k = 0, g_1 > 0, \ldots, g_\ell > 0 \},
\]
be a semialgebraic set defined by \(s = k + \ell\) different polynomials of maximum degree \(d\).
Then there is an algorithm, without oracle, which partitions \(X\) into a family
\[
{\cal X} = (X_0, \ldots, X_n)
\]
such that, if \(X\) is nonsingular, \(X_0 = X\) and all other sets are empty.
Otherwise, \(X_0 = \emptyset\) and each \(X_k, 1 \le k \le n\) is a possibly empty, effectively nonsingular stratum of codimension \(k\).
This algorithm has complexity
\[
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}.
\]
The number of strata does not exceed \(s^{n} (d + 1)^2\), and each stratum is defined by at most \(s (d + 1)^2\) polynomial equations and inequalities of maximum degree \((d + 1)^2\).
\end{theorem}

Let \[
X = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0,\ldots,f_s(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}.

\end{algorithm}

To call this algorithm on a semialgebraic set \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) defined by equations \(F \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) and \(G \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,z_n]\), compute
\[
{\cal X}' = {\rm Stratify}(0, F, (0), (0), G).
\]
to obtain a set of strata \({\cal X'} = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)\).
If all \(X_i = \emptyset, 1 \le i \le k\), then we can conclude that every partial derivative vanishes identically on \(X\). Hence, \(X\) is a smooth subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and we let \(X_0 = X\).
Otherwise, let \(X_0 = \emptyset\) so that \({\cal X} = (\emptyset, X_1,\ldots,x_n)\) where each \(X_i,1\le i \le n\) is a smooth subset of \(X\) of codimension \(i\), such that each \(X_i,X_j,i\ne j\) is pairwise disjoint and \(X_1\cup \ldots \cup X_n = X\).
Note, in the case that \(X_0 = X\), the smooth stratification algorithm provides no information about the dimension of \(X\).

\hypertarget{sec:strat-algorithm-details}{%
\subsection{Subroutines and Algorithm Details}\label{sec:strat-algorithm-details}}

The algorithm employs two subroutines, which were presented in the description as ``black-box functions''.
The first of these is a subroutine which determines whether \(Y_k\) is an open subset of \(U_k\).
This is the case if, for every point \(\mathbf{x}\) in \(Y_k\) all points of \(U_k\) which are sufficiently close to \(\mathbf{x}\) are also in \(Y_k\).
This can be expressed as a first-order Boolean formula with two quantifier alternations and its truth value can be determined by performing quantifier elimination. I.e., \(Y_k\) is an open subset of \(U_k\) if
\[
\forall \mathbf{x} \in Y_k \> \exists \varepsilon > 0 \in \mathbb{R}\> \forall \mathbf{y} \in U_k \mid \Vert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \Vert < \varepsilon \rightarrow \mathbf{y} \in Y_k
\]
An alternative method, as described in \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2, is to check whether every derivative computed at step \(k+1\) vanishes on the set
\[
U_k \cap \{ x_1 = \tt{const} \mid i < i_1 \}
\]
where \(i_k \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\) is a parameter passed from step \(k\) to \(k+1\) in the algorithm.
This, again, reduces to the emptiness check.

The second of these is \(\rm{Empty}(S)\), where \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is a semialgebraic set represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula which is a conjunction of polynomial equations, inequations and inequalities. Note that an inequation \(\{ f(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}\) can be rewritten as \(\{ f(\mathbf{x}) < 0 \lor f(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}\), so it is possible to represent \(S\) by two systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, or a Boolean formula containing the conjunction above. This permits various methods for checking emptiness. We may write \(\rm{Empty}(S)\) as a quantifier elimination problem
\[
\exists \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = \ldots = f_s(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s_1(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, \ldots, s_k(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0.
\]
This problem can be decided using the singly-exponential quantifier elimination algorithm from Proposition \ref{prp:bpr-qe} (\citet{bpr2006}, Algorithm 14.21), which, with one quantifier alternation, has complexity \((sd)^{O(n)}\) where \(s\) is the number of different polynomials defining the set and \(d\) their maximum degree -- singly exponential in the number of variables. Alternatively, the algorithm presented by \citet{bpr98}, which produces a witness point in every cell in a decomposition of the input set, may be used to decide emptiness. This algorithm also has complexity \((sd)^{O(n)}\).
In practice, quantifier elimination can be performed using CAD. This, of course, has complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables: \((sd)^{O(1)^n}\) (see Proposition \ref{prp:collins}).

The algorithm may be implemented as above, but with some small tweaks to simplify the code and make the algorithm work slightly more efficiently.
First, observe that not all derivatives are needed to define the candidate stratum \(Y_k\). One obvious situation is when a derivative \(s_k\) turns out to be a nonzero constant \(c \in \mathbb{A}\).
In the formula for \(Y_k\), the inequation \(c \ne 0\) will appear, which is obviously true. Since \(X' \supset Y_k\) was assumed to be non-empty, we can immediately conclude that \(Y_k\) is non-empty and equal to \(X'\). No further derivatives at step \(k\) need to be considered, since \(X' \setminus Y_1 = \emptyset\).
A similar situation may arise, even with nonconstant functions \(s_k\). For example, for the input set
\[
X := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2 y^2 = 0 \},
\]
the derivative for index \((0,1)\) is \(\partial (x^2 y^2) / \partial x_1 = 2x y^2\), which is equal to zero at every point of \(X\).
By discarding these redundant functions, we minimise the number of polynomials defining sets in the emptiness check. Note that we have to keep track of every derivative computed, even the redundant ones, so that we can find the function \(h_k\) such that \(s_k = \partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j} h_1\).

Now consider the operation of finding the derivative with index \((0,\ldots,0,i_\ell - 1,i_{\ell - 1}, \ldots, i_{k+1},j)\). The following observation allows us to quickly find this polynomial, avoiding a search in \(\cal G\) or unnecesary recomputation of derivatives.
Suppose we are considering index
\[
\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,i_{\ell - 1},\ldots,i_{k+1},j)\]
and want to find the derivative with index
\[
\mathbf{j} = (0,\ldots,0,i_\ell - 1,i_{\ell - 1},\ldots,i_{k+1},j).\]
The set \(\cal G\) includes polynomials computed in previous rounds of induction and those with index \(\mathbf{i} \prec \mathbf{m}\), since we proceed in ascending lexicographical order. Hence \(\cal G\) contains the derivative with index \(\mathbf{j}\).
There is a convenient way to find this derivative.
Let us first illustrate the process with an example. Let \(f_j \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,x_3]\) with \(M_j = (1,2,2)\) and consider the lexicographically ordered list of indices
\[
\begin{matrix}
L_1 :=\ &  (0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,2),&(0,1,0),&(0,1,1),&(0,1,2),&(1,0,0),&(1,0,1)&\ldots\\
L_2 := \ & & (0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,2),&(0,0,0),&(0,0,1)&\ldots.\\
\end{matrix}
\]
Observe that for indices of the kind \((0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)\) in \(L_1\), the corresponding element of \(L_2\) is \((0,\ldots,0)\). For an arbitrary index \((0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,\ldots,i_1)\) in \(L_1\) which appears \(k\) elements after \((0,\ldots,0,i_\ell = 1,0,\ldots,0)\), the corresponding element in \(L_2\) appears \(k\) elements after \((0,\ldots,0)\).
From this, we can introduce an ``index chasing'' method as follows. Let \({\cal G}_j\) be the (ordered) list of derivatives of polynomial \(f_j\). For each \(\mathbf{m}\), we keep a pointer, \({\cal G}'_j\), to the element in \({\cal G}_j\) with index \(\mathbf{j}\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initialise \({\cal G}_j = ((0,\ldots,0),f_j)\). For \(\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,1)\), set \({\cal G}'_j = {\cal G}_j\).
\item
  Now suppose that \({\cal G}_j\) contains all polynomials with index \(\prec \mathbf{m}\).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If \(\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)\), then \(\mathbf{j} = (0,\ldots,0)\) and we set \({\cal G}'_j\) to the head of \({\cal G}_j\).
  \item
    Otherwise, let \({\cal G}'_j\) be the tail of \({\cal G}'_j\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The ``index chasing'' method works efficiently in SACLIB, which uses linked lists. However, we do need to append new derivatives to the end of \({\cal G}_j\), which takes \(O(n)\) steps.
To avoid this, we keep a pointer to the last-but-one element in the list, i.e., suppose \(G_j = (a_1,(\ldots,(a_{r-1},(a_r,(\rm{NIL})))\ldots)\) then \(G_{j,\rm{append}} = (a_{r-1},(a_r,(\rm{NIL})))\). Then, if we wish to append \(b\) to the end of \(G_j\), we simply need to set the tail of \(G_{j,\rm{append}}\) to \((a_r,(b,(NIL)))\).

We can also optimise the construction of the matrix associated to the partial differential operator \(\partial_{\mathbf{h},\mathbf{i},j} f\). In this matrix,
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
 & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{pmatrix},
\]
only the last row depends on \(f\) and only the last column depends on \(j\). Thus, we can save the \((k\times k)\)-submatrix consisting of the first \(k\) rows and columns and only append the new row and column. This matrix can be passed as an argument to \({\rm Stratify}(k,\ldots)\), with the matrix for \(k=0\) being empty (i.e., \(\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{i} = ()\) in the partial differential operator).

We illustrate the smooth stratification algorithm with a worked example in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Consider
\[
\{ x_3 = 0, x_1^2-x_2^2=0 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^3.
\]
This set is contained in the plane \(\{ x_3 = 0 \}\) and consists of the two intersecting straight lines \(\{ x_1 - x_2 = 0 \}\) and \(\{ x_1 + x_2 = 0 \}\) in \({\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_2\}}\).
Note that the algorithm imposes an order on polynomials. Here we take \(f_1 := z\) and \(f_2 = x^2 - y^2\), wiht \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) being assigned indices \((0,0,0,1)\) and \((0,0,0,2)\) respectively.
The algorithm proceeds as follows

\begin{align}
k=0,X'&:=\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\mid x_{3}=0,x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=0\right\} \\\left(0,0,1,1\right)\ h_{1}&=f_{1}=x_{3}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{1}&=0\\Y_{1}&:=\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid0\ne0\right\} =\emptyset\\(0,0,1,2)\ h_{1}&=f_{2}=x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{2}/\partial x_{1}&=2x_{1}\\Y_{1}&:=\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid2x_1\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}&:=\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\mid x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=0,2x_{1}\ne0\right\} \\&\text{Not open, proceed by induction}\\

\end{align}

\begin{align}
k=1,h_{1}=2x,i_{1}=1,X''&:=Y_{1},F=\left\{ f_{1}=x_{3},f_{2}=x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2},f_{3}=2x_{1}\right\} \\\left(0,1,1\right)\ h_{2}&=f_{1}=x_{3}\\s_{2}&=0\\\left(0,1,2\right)\ h_{2}&=f_{2}=x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}\\s_{2}=\det\begin{pmatrix}\partial h_{1}/\partial x_{1} & \partial h_{1}/\partial x_{2}\\

\end{align}

As expected, the algorithm outputs the set of strata
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{X}_{1}:=&\emptyset\\\mathcal{X}_{2}:=&\left\{ x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2}=0,x_{3}=0,2x_{1}\ne0\right\} \\\mathcal{X}_{3}:=&\left\{ (0,0,0)\right\}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Determining the codimension and basic formula for each stratum}\label{determining-the-codimension-and-basic-formula-for-each-stratum}}

\citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2 assert that each stratum of codimension \(k\) can be represented by a conjunction containing \(k\) equations. I.e., each stratum is basic. A naive implementation of the procedure leads to a non-basic representation as shown in the following example

\begin{example}
Consider the semialgebraic set
\[
S := \{ (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1 x_2 = 0 \}
\]
Apply the algorithm.
\begin{align*}
k=0,X':=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid f_{1}:=x_{1}x_{2}=0\right\} \\\left(0,1,1\right)h_{1}=&f_{1}=x_{1}x_{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{1}=&x_{2}\\Y_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid y\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^2\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,x_{2}\ne0\right\} \\&\text{Proceed by induction}\\
k=1,h_{1}=f_{1},i_{1}=1,X'':=&Y_{1},F_{1}=\left\{ f_{1}\right\} \\\left(1,1\right),h_{2}=&f_{1}\\s_{2}=&\begin{pmatrix}\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{1} & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}\\
\partial f_{2}/\partial x_{1} & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}
\end{pmatrix}=0\\&\text{since both columns are equal.}\\\text{Return. }Y_{1}&\text{ is smooth.}\\
\end{align*}

Observe that the formula for \(Y_1\) contains one equation, \(h_1 = f_1\). Hence \(Y_1\) is a smooth stratum in basic representation and we can conclude that it has codimension \(1\).

For the next nonzero derivative, with index \((1,0,1)\), we get
\begin{align*}
k=0,X':=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,y=0\right\} \\\left(1,0,1\right)\ h_{1}=&f_{1}=x_{1}x_{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}=&x_{1}\\Y_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid x_{1}\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,x_{1}\ne0\right\} \\&\text{Proceed by indection.}\\k=1,h_{1}=f_{1},i_{1}=2,X'':=&Y_{1}\ldots\\&\text{No partial derivatives can be computed.}\\\text{Return. }Y_{1}&\text{ is smooth.}
\end{align*}

Notice that the inductive step returns immediately. This is because \(i_1=2\), so it is not possible to take further partial derivatives with respect to \(j > i_1\). In the formula for
\[
Y_1 := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid f_1 := x_1 x_2 = 0, h_1 := x_2 = 0, x_1 \ne 0 \},
\]
two different equations, \(f_1\) and \(h_1\) appear. However, \(Y_1\) is not in basic representation. Indeed, the equation \(f_1=0\) is redundant, since \(f_1\) is equal to zero for all points at which \(h_1\) is equal to zero. Thus \(f_1\) can be discarded, and we see that only one equation, \(h_1\), is required to represent \(Y_1\) in basic form. We can conclude that \(Y_1\) is smooth and has codimension \(1\).

Finally, consider the derivative with index \((1,1,1)\).
\begin{align*}
k=0,X':=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,x_{2}=0,x_{1}=0\right\} \\\left(1,1,1\right)\ h_{1}=&s_{1}^{\left(0,1,1\right)}=x_{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}=&1\\Y_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid1\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{2}=0,1\ne0\right\}
\end{align*}
Again, the inductive step returns immediately because \(i_1=2\), but this time we can see that \(Y_1\) is not an open subset of \(U_1\). As mentioned above, the algorithm is unable to determine this without solving a quantifier elimination problem. Instead, we may be able to determine the codimension by looking at the basic representation of \[
Y_1 := \{ (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1 x_2 = 0, x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0 \}.
\]
(Note that the constraint \(1 \ne 0\) is dropped since it is trivial and adds no information.)
We see that three equations appear in the definition of \(Y_1\), but the first one, \(f_1 := x_1 y_2\) is redundant again. Thus, the two equations \(x_2 = 0, x_1 = 0\) define \(Y_1\) and we can conclude that \(Y_1\) is smooth and has codimension \(2\).
\end{example}

This example shows two things. Firstly, not all functions are required to represent the smooth stratum and secondly \(k\), the current step of induction, gives a lower bound on the codimension of strata.
\citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2 states that
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}\partial h_{1}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial h_{1}/\partial x_{i_{k}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\partial h_{k}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial h_{k}/\partial x_{i_{k}}
\end{pmatrix}\ne0
\]
at every point of a stratum \(X_k\) of codimension \(k\) which includes the functions \(h_1,\ldots,h_k\) in its definition.
As we saw in the example, other functions vanish at every point of \(X_k\). We need to find the ``basic'' set of \(k\) functions needed to define \(X_k\).

\hypertarget{discarding-redundant-equations}{%
\subsection{Discarding redundant equations}\label{discarding-redundant-equations}}

Let \(F \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a set of polynomials, indexed by \((m_{i_1},\ldots,m_1,j)\) and, for \(\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,m_\ell,\ldots,m_1,j),\ell > i_1\) let
\[
s^{m_n,\ldots,m_1,j}_k = \partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, n}^{m_n} \partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, i_1 + 1}^{m_{i_1 + 1}} f
\]
be the partial derivative computed at index \(\mathbf{m}\), where \(f \in F\) has index \((m_1,\ldots,m_1,j)\) be one of the partial derivatives computed during the algorithm.
Denote by \(G\) the set of derivatives with index lexicographically less than \(\mathbf{m}\). \(Y_k \subset Y_{k-1}\) is defined such that every function in \(G\) is equal to zero while the function \(h^{\mathbf{m}}_k\) is not.
Define the smooth manifold
\[
U_k := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid h_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, h_{k-1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, h_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s^{\mathbf{m}}_k(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}.
\]
of codimension \(k\), where the function \(h_k := s^{(0,\ldots,0,m_\ell - 1,m_{\ell - 1},\ldots,m_1,j)}_k\). According to \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2, \(Y_k\) is smooth and has codimension \(k\) if it is an open subset of \(U_k\). In this case, only \(k\) of the polynomials will be needed to define \(Y_k\). Note that inequations \(s_1,\ldots,s_{k-1}\) which appear in the definition of \(Y_{k-1} \supset Y_k\) should also be taken into account.
Begin with a set
\[
Y' := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid h_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, h_{k-1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s_1(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, \ldots, s_(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, s_k(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \} \subset Y_k.
\]
Consider each function \(g \in G\) in reverse lexicographical order. If \(g(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) at every point \(\mathbf{x} \in Y'\) then it is redundant and should be discarded. Otherwise, \(g\) should be included in the defining equations for \(Y_k\). Since \(Y_k\) has codimension \(k\), and \(Y'\) is already an open, basic set of codimension \(k-1\), only one more polynomial should be needed.
If \(Y_k\) is not an open subset of \(U_k\), then more polynomials will be required to define it, and the number of polynomials gives the codimension.

A polynomial \(g \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) is redundant in the definition of the semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) if the following formula is true
\[
\exists x_1,\ldots,x_n,a \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in S, a \ne 0, g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = a.
\]
This problem can also be formulated using the emptiness check. \(g\) is redundant in the definition of \(S\) if the semialgebraic set
\[
\{ \mathbf{x} \in S \mid g(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}
\]
is non-empty.

\hypertarget{sec:strat-semialgebraic}{%
\subsection{From Basic Algebraic sets to Arbitrary Semialgebraic sets}\label{sec:strat-semialgebraic}}

\citet{gv1995}, Corollary 1 asserts that the algorithm can be applied to arbitrary semi-pfaffian sets and, therefore, without modification, to arbitrary semialgebraic sets.
Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula containing polynomials
\[
f_1,\ldots,f_s.
\]
Consider each ``sign set''
\[
S_{( \ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s )} := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) \ast_1 0, \ldots, f_s(\mathbf{x}) \ast_s 0 \}
\]
where \(\ast_i, 1 \le i \le s \in \{<, >, =\}\). \(S\) can be partitioned into a finite union of some of the \(s^3\) sign sets.
If we apply the smooth stratification algorithm to each \(S_{(\ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s)} \subset S\), and take the union of strata, we will obtain a smooth stratification of the set \(S\). Indeed, since no two sign sets have non-empty intersection, it is clear that no two strata intersect, and since a finite number of the sign-sets form a partition of \(S\), the smooth strata of these sign-sets also forms a partition of \(S\).

\subsection{Implementation in C}\label{implementation-in-c}}

This algorithm has been implemented in \texttt{C}, using the computer algebra library \texttt{SACLIB}. \texttt{QEPCAD} is used to perform emptyness checks using cylindrical algebraic decomposition. Below is an example of the program's output, given the basic semialgebraic set
\[
\{ z = 0, x^2 - y^2 = 0 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^3,
\]
discussed in Section \ref{sec:strat-worked-example}.

\end{verbatim}

The program works in a similar way to \texttt{QEPCAD} (see Section \ref{sec:qepcad}), taking as input the variable list (which specifies the order) and a conjunction of polynomial equations, inequations and inequalities (written as a QEPCAD ``prenex'' formula). The stratification is then computed and there is a basic REPL which allows the user to see information about the polynomials and strata produced.

Exerpts of the code are now presented and discussed. The entrypoint for the algorithm is \texttt{stratify}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For the base case, where there are no polynomials, or index \(i_k \ge r\), (Line 7), there is nothing to do. No strata are appended and no polynomials computed.
\item
  Prior to Line 57, initialisation is done. Metadata for each polynomial in \texttt{Fs} is stored.
\item
  The main loop, beginning on Line 57, computes partial derivatives in ascending lexicographical order of index \((i_r,\ldots,i_{k+1},j)\), \(1 \le j \le \rm{np}\).
\item
  Lines 57-100 keeps track of the current polynomial \texttt{P} and ``differentiation variable'' \texttt{v} \(\in x_{i_k+1},\ldots,i_r\).
\item
  Line 101 calls the function \texttt{JacobiFromMinor}, which takes a \(((k-1)\times (k-1))\)-matrix \(A = \vert a_{ij} \vert = \partial h_i / \partial x_j\), a polynomial \(f\) and index \(\ell\), and returns the \((k \times k)\)-matrix obtained from \(A\) by appending column \((\partial h_1 / \partial x_\ell, \ldots, \partial h_{k-1} / \partial x_\ell)^T\) and row \((\partial f / \partial x_{i_1}, \ldots, \partial f / \partial x_{i_{k-1}}, \partial f / \partial \ell)\). I.e., it constructs the matrix from the partial differential operator (Definition \ref{def:pdo}) and saves recomputing the whole matrix of partial derivatives. Note that, when \(k=1\), \texttt{JacobiFromMinor} returns the one-element matrix \(\partial f / \partial \ell\).
\item
  On line 105, the determinant of the matrix computed on Line 101 is calculated, for the partial differential operator.
\item
  Line 116 determines if the candidate stratum is empty (see comment on Lines 112-115).
\item
  If non-empty, we proceed by induction, calling \texttt{strat\_helper} recursively (for \(k+1\), appending index \texttt{v} and polynomial \texttt{P}, and passing the \((k \times k\)-matrix as the \texttt{Minor}). The number of strata of codimension \(> k\) which were added to \texttt{S} is returned. If no strata were appended, all the partial derivatives vanish identically on the candidate, and we can conclude that it is smooth and has codimension \(k\).
\item
  Line 128 represents the candidate stratum as a basic semialgebraic set containing \(k\) equations. The function \texttt{construct\_stratum\_basic} is discussed shortly.
\item
  The rest of the function is responsible for updating the metadata and keeping track of the list of polynomials \texttt{Gs1} to be returned.
\end{itemize}

The function \texttt{construct\_stratum\_basic} is responsible for representing a candidate stratum as a basic semialgebraic set defined using \(k\) polynomial equations. It discards redundant polynomials as described in Section \ref{sec:strat-algorithm-details}.

The idea is to use emptiness checking to find the minimal number, \texttt{k1} of equations needed to define the stratum \(Y\) as a basic semialgebraic set. \texttt{k1} is the codimension of \(Y\).

The function constructs \(F\), the defining formula for \(S\) and uses QEPCAD to construct a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^r\) compatible with \(S\). If \(S\) is empty, then this CAD will contain no true cells, so the function checks this condition.

\hypertarget{sec:strat-complexity}{%
\section{Complexity Analysis}\label{sec:strat-complexity}}

We first briefly summarise the semi-Pfaffian case, as presented by \citet{gv1995}.
The algorithm from \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 2 takes as input a semi-Pfaffian set with the format \((r, N, \alpha, \beta, n)\) (see Definition \ref{def:pfaff-format}) and has a complexity upper bound of
\[
3^N N^{n+1} {\cal B}
\]
where
\[
{\cal B} = (\alpha + \beta + 1)^{(r+1)^{O(n)}}.
\]
Without the Oracle, the total number of strata, some of which may be empty, does not exceed \(N^{n+r}{\cal B}\), each of which has format \((r, N{\cal B},\alpha, {\cal B}, n)\).
If the Oracle, used for checking emptiness, is allowed, then the algorithm has complexity not exceeding \(N^{n+r}{\cal B}\).

Now consider this algorithm applied to the semialgebraic set
\begin{equation}
X := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1 = 0, \ldots, f_k = 0, g_1 > 0, \ldots, g_\ell > 0 \},
\label{eq:strat-imput-set}
\end{equation}
where all \(s := k + \ell\) functions \(f_i,g_j\) are polynomials with maximum degree \(d\) -- Pfaffian functions of order \(0\) and degree \((\alpha, \beta)\).
The upper complexity bound for the algorithm without Oracle is
\[
3^{s} s^{n+1} (d + 1)^2.
\]
The number of strata, some of which may be empty, does not exceed
\[s^{n} (d + 1)^2.\]
Each stratum is defined by at most \(s (d + 1)^2\) polynomial equations and inequalities of maximum degree \((d + 1)^2\).
If the Oracle is allowed, no empty strata will be produced and the algorithm has complexity not exceeding
\[
s^{n+1} (d + 1)^2.
\]
These bounds follow immediately from \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 6.2.
We will now analyse the complexity of the algorithm presented in Section \ref{sec:strat-alg-description}, which performs emptiness checking on candidate strata.

There are \(s^{n} (d + 1)^2\) candidate strata \(Y_k\), and the algorithm determines whether each of them is empty, in order to decide whether all partial differential equations vanish identically on the input set \(X\).
In the implementation, the check is done using CAD (a call to \texttt{QEPCAD-B}).
For the purposes of complexity analysis, we will use a theoretical algorithm, having singly exponential complexity in the number of variables.
\citet{bpr98} propose an algorithm which takes a semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) defined by \(s\) polynomials with maximum degree \(d\) in \(n < s\) variables and produces a ``witness'' -- a point contained in every cell in a decomposition of \(S\).
The algorithm can be used to determine the emptiness of \(S\) and requires \(s(s/n)^n d^{O(n)}\) arithmetic operations.
This is asymptotically the same as \[(sd)^{O(n)}.\]
Using the bounds for the number and degrees of polynomials defining strata, each emptiness check costs
\[
\left(s(d+1)^{2}(d+1)^{2}\right)^{O(n)}=\left(s(d+1)^{4}\right)^{O(n)},
\]
which is asymptotically the same as
\[
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)}
\]
This operation must be performed for all of the
\(s^{n} (d + 1)^{2}\)
candidate strata, resulting in a total complexity for emptiness checking of
\[
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}.
\]
The total complexity of stratification, given by the sum of the complexity of applying the algorithm and performing the emptiness checks, is
\[
3^{s}s^{n+1}(d+1)^{2}+\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}.
\]
Since \(s^{n+1}(d+1)^{2}\) is bounded from above by \(\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}\), we get a total complexity upper bound of
\[
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}.
\]

\chapter{Quasi-affine cells}\label{sec:quasi-affine}}

In this section, we develop an algorithm, based on \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.19, for constructing a CAD whose two-, one-, and zero-dimensional cells are the graphs of quasi-affine maps. This is the first step to constructing a monotone cylindrical decomposition, as described in \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:bgv-quasi}{}\label{prp:bgv-quasi}\citep[Theorem 3.19]{bgv15}

Let \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) be bounded deﬁnable subsets in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with \(\dim (V_i) \le 2\) for each
\(1 \le i \le k\).
Then there is a cylindrical cell decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compatible with each \(V_i\) such that every cylindrical cell contained in \(V := V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map.
\end{proposition}

The following will be proved.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm}{}\label{thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm}Let
\[
F_1,\ldots,F_k
\]
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas containing \(s\) different polynomials \(\mathbf{F} = \{ f_1,\ldots, f_s \} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), having maximum degree \(d\), such that \(F_i, 1\le i \le k\) defines a bounded semialgebraic set \(V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\).

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) as input, which constructs an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map. \(\mathcal{D}\) is obviously compatible with each \(V_1,\ldots,V_K\).
This algorithm has complexity
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{2^{O(n)}},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

\section{Computing the smooth two-dimensional locus of V}\label{computing-the-smooth-two-dimensional-locus-of-v}}

The proof of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.19 begins by introducing \(W\), the smooth \(2\)-dimensional locus of \(V = V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\).
Since \(V\) is a semialgebraic set, it can be represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F\).
\(W\) can be computed using the smooth stratification algorithm described in \ref{sec:smooth-strat}.
In order to apply the algorithm, consider the sign sets \(S_{(\ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s)} \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) of polynomials \(f_1,\ldots,f_s\) appearing in the formula \(F\), as described in Section \ref{sec:strat-semialgebraic}. Observe that a finite number of these sign-sets \(S_1,\ldots,S_m\) form a partition of \(V\).
For each \(S_i \subset V\), apply the smooth stratification algorithm to obtain a family \((X_{i,1}, \ldots X_{i,n})\) of strata, where each \(X_{i,j}\) is a smooth subset of \(S_i\) of codimension \(j\).
We have \(\dim(S_i) \le 2\), since each of the sets in the union \(V\) has dimension at most 2. Hence, every stratum \(X_{i,j}\) of codimension \(j < n-2\) will be empty.
We obtain the smooth two-dimensional locus of \(V\) by taking the union of strata of codimension \(n-2\). For each stratum, it is important to keep the set of \(n-2\) polynomials defining it, as these will be needed in the next step. We will need the strata of codimension \(n-1\), as each one-dimensional cell must also be the graph of a quasi-affine map.

\hypertarget{an-alternative-method-for-computing-the-smooth-two-dimensional-locus}{%
\subsection{An alternative method for computing the smooth two-dimensional locus}\label{an-alternative-method-for-computing-the-smooth-two-dimensional-locus}}

Recall from Section \ref{sec:cad-construction}) that smooth cells can be guaranteed by choosing a certain projection operator.
More precisely, according to \citet{mccallum1988}, Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, if there is a finite number of blow-up points, then the McCallum projection operator will result in a CAD where all cells are analytic submanifolds.
Since \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) for all \(1 \le i \le k\), blow-up points in \({\operatorname{cl} \left( ( \right)}V_i)\) have dimension at most \(0\) (see the Remark after Definition \ref{def:blow-up-point}).
Hence, the McCallum projection operator is sufficient to produce smooth cells.

Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be the set of different polynomials appearing in the quantifier-free Boolean formulas defining \(V\) and use the McCallum projection operator to construct an \(F\)-invariant CAD, \(\cal E\), of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Since cells of a CAD are disjoint by construction and smooth by the use of the McCallum projection operator, \(\cal E\) forms a smooth stratification of \(V\).
Thus, we can take as \(W\) the (separate) sets of \(2\)- and \(1\)-dimensional cells of \(\cal E\) which are contained in \(V\).
Recall, from Definition \ref{def:cells}, that each cylindrical cell has a corresponding multi-index \((i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{0,1\}^n\).
Let \(C \subset V\) be a \(2\)-dimensional be a cell of \(\mathcal{E}\), and suppose it has index \((i_1,\ldots,i_n)\). Since \(\dim(C) = 2\), \(\sum_{1\le i \le n} = 2\). Let \(i_{j_1}, = i_{j_2} = 1\) for \(j_1 \ne j_2\) while all other elements of the index be equal to zero. Then \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(C)\), for \(k\ne j_1,k\ne j_2\), is the root of a projection polynomial \(f_k \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k]\). Hence, we have, \(n-2\) projection polynomials at which every \(\mathbf{x} \in C\) is equal to zero.
The polynomials can be determined by using the set of signs of projection factors and used to define an algebraic variety \(Y \supset C\). Note that we need some additional inequalities to define \(C\) properly, but these are not needed to compute the critical points of projections in the next section.
Similarly for \(1\)-dimensional cells, only one element of the index will be equal to \(1\), while all other elements are equal to \(0\). It follows that we can find \(n-1\) polynomials, in a similar way, which are equal to zero on each one-dimensional cell.

It is possible to compute \(W\) using either technique. Theoretically speaking, using the smooth stratification algorithm seems cleaner, as it is the correct tool for the job. In addition, the bound on number of strata is singly exponential, while the bound on number of CAD cells is doubly exponential. An estimate for the number of cells of strata having a certain dimension is not currently known, but it seems likely that the number of strata will be less than the number of CAD cells.
\citet{gv04}, Theorem 3.7 gives a method (which can be turned into an algorithm) for efficiently listing all sign sets associated with a set of polynomials and \citet{bpr2006}, Algorithm 14.21 describes how quantifier elimination can be performed in singly exponential time.
However, in the implementation
CAD is used to perform the emptiness check. Thus, the second option seems more appealing because a single recomputation of the CAD is preferrable to many calls to the CAD algorithm, which would be required for the stratification-based approach in the form that it has been implemented.
In addition, \citet{kremer2020} propose an algorithm, along with its implementation, for refining a CAD to be compatible with new polynomials. This gives us hope that we may be able to avoid a full re-computation. In conclusion, the second option, where we compute an initial CAD consisting of smooth cells, is more tractable in practice.

\section{Ensuring that every cell is the graph of a quasi-affine map}\label{ensuring-that-every-cell-is-the-graph-of-a-quasi-affine-map}}

We now discuss how to obtain quasi-affine cells. A \(k\)-dimensional cell \(C\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map if, for each affine coordinate subspace \(L \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), the image of the projection map \(\operatorname{proj}_{L}(C)\) is \(k\)-dimensional if and only if the map \(\operatorname{proj}_{L}\vert_C\) is injective (see Definition \ref{def:quasi-affine}).
In order to satisfy this property, \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19 states that the CAD \(\cal D\) also needs to be compatible with the critical points, \(W_{i}\) and \(W_{i,j}\), of projections of \(W\) onto one and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces \({\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}\) and \({\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}\).

Let \(W'_k\) be one of the strata (or smooth cylindrical cells) computed in the previous section, with \(k\in \{1,2\}\). Since \(W'_k\) has codimension \(n-k\) and is a basic semialgebraic set, its formula contains \(n-k\) polynomial equations and, possibly, some inequalities.
Consider the Jacobi matrix
\[
J_{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell}:=\begin{pmatrix}\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{i_{\ell}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\partial f_{k}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial f_{n-k}/\partial x_{i_{\ell}}
\end{pmatrix},
\]
where \(\{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell\} \subset \{ 1, \ldots, n \}\). Let \(\{j_1,\ldots,j_{n-\ell}\} = \{ 1 , \ldots, n \} \setminus \{ i_1,\ldots,i_\ell \}\).
Regular points of the projection of \(W'\) onto \({\operatorname{span} \{j_1,\ldots,j_{n - \ell}\}}\) are those at which the matrix \(J_{i_1,\ldots,i_\ell}\) has full rank.
Thus, we can compute the critical points \(W'_{i,j}\) of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}}}\) by finding the points at which the Jacobi matrix \(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}\) does not have full rank.

Note that, for \(W'_{i,j}\), the corresponding \(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}\) will be a \(((n-2) \times (n-2))\)-matrix, so we simply need to find the points at which \(\det(J_{\{1\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}) = 0\).
On the other hand, \(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}}\) will be an \(((n-2) \times (n-1))\)-matrix. It will fail to have full rank if the determinants of all of the \(((n-2) \times (n-2))\)-minors is zero. Observe that the minors of \(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}}, i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\) are the \(((n-2)\times (n-2))\)-jacobi matrices \(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}}, j \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}\). I.e., they will coincide with the square matrices associated with \(W'_{i,j}\). Thus, we need to make the CAD have constant sign on the determinants of each of the matrices
\[
J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i,j\}} \text{ for all } 1 \le i < j \le n,
\]
for all two-dimensional smooth strata (or cells) of \(V\), whose definition includes \(n-2\) polynomial equations.

Now consider the critical points \(Z\) of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}}}(W'_1)\), where \(W'_1\) is a smooth one-dimensional stratum. If \(\dim(Z) = 1\), then every point of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}}}(W'_1)\) is critical as \(W'_1\) is smooth. Note that \(z\) may contain zero-dimensional critical points of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}}}\) and \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}}}}\).
Otherwise, \(\dim(Z) = 0\), so \(Z\) is a collection of isolated points \((c_i,c_j)\). \(c_i\) is also a critical point of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}}}(W'_1)\) and \(c_j\) is also a critical point of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}}}}(W'_1)\). Therefore, it is sufficient to consider only critical points of projections onto one-dimensional coordinate subspaces. Hence, we only consider Jacobi matrices
\(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}}\) for all \(1\le i \le n\), for the \(n-1\) polynomials defining \(W'_1\). Critical points are those at which their determinants are equal to zero.

\hypertarget{correctness-and-complexity}{%
\section{Correctness and Complexity}\label{correctness-and-complexity}}

Correctness of Theorem \ref{thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm} follows from the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19. Let \(\mathcal{E}\) be the CAD computed by the algorithm from Section \ref{sec:quasiaffine-algorithm}, using the McCallum projection operator, in which each cell has constant sign on the polynomials defining sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\).
By \citet{mccallum1988}, Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, each cell \(C \subset V\) of \(\cal E\) will be an analytic submanifold, since \(\dim(V_i) \le 2, 1\le i \le k\).
The algorithm then makes the CAD compatible with the determinants of matrices \(J_{C_2,\mathbf{m}}\) and \(J_{C_1,\mathbf{m}}\), defined in Equations \eqref{eq:jacobi-two} and \eqref{eq:jacobi-one} respectively. These are the critical points of projections of two- and one- dimensional smooth cylindrical cells \(C \subset V_1,\ldots,V_k\). Thus, \(\mathcal{D}\), the CAD output by the algorithm from Section \ref{sec:quasiaffine-algorithm} is compatible with the critical points of projections of the smooth two-dimensional locus of \(V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k\) onte one- and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces, as required in the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19.

\hypertarget{sec:quasi-complexity}{%
\subsection{Complexity Analysis}\label{sec:quasi-complexity}}

Let us examine the complexity by supposing that the smooth stratification algorithm is used to find the smooth two-dimensional locus of \(V = V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), defined by \(s\) polynomials having maximum degree \(d\).
By the result from Section \ref{sec:strat-complexity}, the smooth stratification step with emptiness checking has complexity
\[
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}
\]
The critical points of one- and two- dimensional strata are then computed. This is done by computing determinants of \((n-1)\)- and \((n-2)\)-dimensional Jacobi matrices, containing the \(n-1\) and \(n-2\) polynomial equations which define the strata of codimension \(1\) and \(2\) respectively.
These polynomials have maximum degree \((d + 1)^{2}\).
In order to estimate the maximum degree of polynomials appearing in the Jacobi determinant of a \((k \times k)\)-matrix, suppose that elementary row operations -- swapping two rows, multiplying a row by a number and adding one row to another -- will be used to convert the matrix into upper triangular form, then the elements on the main diagonal will be multiplied. Note that the complexity of performing these row operations to transform the matrix into row echelon form has complexity \(O\left(n^2\right)\).
Elementary row operationns do not change the upper bound on degree. For the determinant, multiplying \(k\) polynomials of maximum degree \(d\) will result in a polynomial of maximum degree \(kd\). Thus, the maximum degree of the determinant of the \(((n-2)\times (n-2))\)-matrix will be \((n-2)(d + 1)^{2}\) and the \(((n-1) \times (n-1))\)-matrix will be \((n-1)(d + 1)^{2}\). These are both bounded from above by
\[
n (d + 1)^{2},
\]

For the critical points of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}}}, 1 \le i \le n\), there will be \(n\) Jacobi determinants, and for \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}}}, 1 \le i < j \le n\), there will be \((n-1) + (n-2) + \cdots + 1 = \tfrac{1}{2} (n-1)n\), which is asymptotically the same as \(n^2\).
Accordirg to Section \ref{sec:strat-complexity}, the smooth stratification algorithm will produce at most \(s^n (d+1)^2\). The bound on the number of strata of each codimension is not known, but the total number of strata is, of course, an upper bound. Therefore, there will be at most \(n \left(s^n (d+1)^2\right)\) additional polynomials.

A classical CAD, having constant sign on the \(s\) input polynomials along with the \(n \left(s^n (d+1)^2\right)\) Jacobi determinants, which have maximum degree \(n(d + 1)^{2}\), is then constructed.
According to Proposition \ref{prp:collins} (\citet{bpr2006}, Algorithm 11.2), classical CAD has complexity
\[
\left(s'd'\right)^{O(1)^{n}},
\]
where \(s'\) is the number of input polynomials and \(d'\) their maximum degree.
Using the bounds obtained from the application of smooth stratification, we get
\[
\left(\left(s+n\left(s^{n}(d+1)^{2}\right)\right)n\left(d+1\right)^{2}\right)^{O(1)^{n}},
\]
Which can be simplified to
\[
\left(n s^n \left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^n}.
\]
Since the expression \(n^{O(1)^{n}}\) can be simplified to \(2^{O(1)^{n}}\) we get an upper complexity bound, for constructing a quasi-affine CAD, of
\[
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]
By Proposition \ref{prp:collins}, this is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials defining the CAD and their maximum degree.

Adding the stratification step, we get a total complexity of
\[
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}
+ \left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}},
\]
which is bounded from above by the doubly exponential CAD computation, leading to a complexity upper bound of
\[
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]

\hypertarget{sec:monotone-cells}{%
\chapter{Monotone Cells}\label{sec:monotone-cells}}

So far, we have constructed an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compatible with a family of bounded semialgebraic sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) of dimension at most two, in which every cell \(C\subset V_1\cup \ldots\cup V_k\) is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.
We now return to \citep[ Theorem 3.20]{bgv15} and discuss how to obtain monotone cells, starting with this quasi-affine decomposition.

We first present a motivating example, of a 2-dimensional cylindrical cell which is quasi-affine but not monotone.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:monotone-cells}{}\label{exm:monotone-cells}\citep[Example 3.2]{bgv15}

Let
\[
\Delta := \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid 0 < x < 1, y > 0, x + y < 1 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2
\] and
\[
\varphi(x,y) = x^2 + y^2.
\]
Let \(Y \subset \mathbb{R}^3\) be the graph of function \(\phi\) on \(\Delta\). Observe that \(Y\) is a cylindrical cell and \(\varphi\vert_\Delta\) is a quasi-affine map, since it is strictly increasing in both \(x\) and \(y\).
However, \(y \cap \{ z = 3/4 \}\) is not connected, hence \(\phi\vert_\Delta\) is not a monotone function and \(Y\) is not a monotone cell.
\end{example}

\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:sub-cad}{}\label{def:sub-cad}Let \(\cal D\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and suppose that \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_k)\) is a \(0\)-dimensional section cell in the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\).
By \citep[ Remark 3.8]{bgv15}, the set of all cells of \(\cal D\) contained in the affine coordinate subspace
\[
\{ x_1=c_1,\dots,x_k=c_k \}
\]
forms a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-k}\). This decomposition will be called the \emph{sub-decomposition} of \(\cal D\) above \(c\), and \(\mathbf{c}\) the \emph{base cell} of the sub-decomposition (or sub-CAD).
\end{definition}

The construction of monotone cells is based on the following result due to \citet{bgv15}.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:bgv-monotone}{}\label{prp:bgv-monotone}\citep[Lemma 3.18]{bgv15}

Let \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^2\) be an open, bounded set and \(f : X \to \mathbb{R}\) be a quasi-affine function.
Then there is a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) compatible with \(X\), obtained by intersecting \(X\) with straight lines \[\{x_1 = c\}\] and half-planes \[\{x_1 < c\},\{x_1 > c\}\] such that the restriction \(f\vert_B\) for every cell \(B \subset X\) is a monotone function.
\end{proposition}

We now summarise the construction presented by \citet{bgv15} in the proof of Theorem 3.20.
Their proof proceeds by induction on \(n\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The base case, \(n=1\) is straightforward, since \((0)\) and \((1)\)-cells are already monotone.
\item
  When \(n>1\), consider each two-dimensional cell \(C\) of \(\cal D\) and let \(C'' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C)\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \(\dim(C'') = 0\), apply the inductive hypothesis to the sub-decomposition of \(\cal D\) above \(C''\).
  \item
    Otherwise, \(C\) has index \(\{1,i_2,\dots,i_n\} \in \{0,1\}^n\). Let \(\alpha\) be the smallest among \(\{2,\dots,n\}\) such that \(i_\alpha = 1\). Since \(\dim(C) = 2\), only \(i_1\) and \(i_\alpha\) are equal to \(1\), while all other elements of the index are equal to \(0\). By \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.3, \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n\}}}}(C)\), for all \(i \in \{2,\ldots,\alpha-1,\alpha+1,\ldots,n\}\), is a cylindrical cell and \(C\) is the graph of a continuous function from this cell to \({\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}\).

    \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19, which provides the construction of \(\cal D\) in the previous section, gives us a more useful representation of \(C\). Let \(X := {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}}}(C)\) be a \(2\)-dimensional sector cell. \(C\) can be viewed as the graph of a quasi-affine map
    \[
    \mathbf{f} = (f_1,\dots,f_{n-2}) : X \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_2,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}, x_{\alpha+1},\ldots,x_n\}}.
    \]
    By \citep[Lemma 3.18]{bgv15}, there exists a refinement of the CAD of \({\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}\), obtained by intersecting \(X\) with straight lines and half-planes of the kind
    \[
    \{x_1 < c\}, \{x_1 = c\}, \{x_1 > c\}
    \]
    where \(c \in \mathbb{R}\), such that \(X\) is a union of monotone sector cells \(B\) and \(f_j\vert_B\) is a monotone function.
    By \citep[ Lemma 3.11]{bgv15}, refinements of this kind preserve the cylindrical structure of \(\cal D\) and do not destroy existing monotone cells.
    In the semialgebraic case, we will see that the refinement points \(c\) will always be algebraic numbers, which makes implementation using computer algebra systems possible.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the following sections, we will apply the construction given in the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Theorems 3.20 and 3.18 to develop an algorithm for finding the set of refinement points in the semialgebraic case, starting with the cad \(\mathcal{D}\) and its set of input polynomials \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\). The following will be proved.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm}{}\label{thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm}Let
\[
F_1,\ldots,F_k
\]
be quantifier-free Boolean formulas such that \(F_i, 1\le i \le k\) defines a bounded semialgebraic set \(V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\).
Let \(\mathbf{F} = \{f_1,\ldots,f_s\}\) be a set of polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) of maximum degree \(d\) and \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with each \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(\mathcal{D}\) as input, which produces a refinement \(\mathcal{D'}\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) monotone with respect to each \(V_1, \ldots, V_k\).
This algorithm has complexity
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{{O(1)^n}},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

\hypertarget{sec:monotone-sectors}{%
\section{Two-dimensional monotone sector cells}\label{sec:monotone-sectors}}

Let \(C\) be an \((i_1,\ldots,i_n)\)-cell such that \(i_1 = i_\alpha = 1\) and all other elements of the index are equal to \(0\).
The proof of Proposition \ref{prp:bgv-monotone} proceeds in two stages: first, \(X \subset {\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}\) is refined such that each \(Y \subset X\) is a monotone 2-dimensional sector cell.
Consider the intersection \(X \cap \{x_1 = c\}\) for all \(c\in \mathbb{R}\). This intersection is a finite union of pairwise disjoint intervals. Let \({\cal I} (c)\) be the family of these intervals associated with the point \(c\). Define
\[
\gamma := \{ (x_1,x_\alpha) \in {\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}} \mid x_\alpha \text{ is an endpoint of an interval in } {\cal I}(x_1) \}.
\]
Although the cell \(X\) under consideration is a \(2\)-dimensional cylindrical cell in \({\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}\), we actually need to refine the \(2\)-dimensional cylindrical sector cell \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}}}(C)\) in the cylindrical decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}\). Thus, we need a way to translate between \(C'\) and \(X\).

\begin{corollary}
\protect\hypertarget{cor:gamma-top-bottom}{}\label{cor:gamma-top-bottom}

(to Proposition \ref{prp:delete-zero-index} (\citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.3))

Let \(C\subset \mathbb{R}^\alpha\) be a \((1,0,\ldots,0,1)\)-cell, \(X := {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}}} (C)\) and \(X' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C)\). Suppose we have the family \({\cal I}(c), c \in X'\) and set of one-dimensional curves associated with \(C\) by \(\gamma\). Then

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}}}\vert_C\) is injective.
\item
  \(X\) is a \(2\)-dimensional cylindrical sector cell.
\item
  For each \(c \in X'\), the family \({\cal I}(c)\) contains a single open interval.
\item
  \(\gamma\) consists of zero, one or two disjoint curve intervals which coincide with the top and bottom of \(X\). Furthermore, connected components of \(\gamma\) can be defined as the graph of continuous definable functions from \(X'\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), using the functions defining the cell \(C\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{corollary}

The above follows from \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.3 and the property that \(C\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map. An alternative proof is given here.

\begin{proof}
Since \(C\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map from \(X \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_2,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}\}}\), it follows that the projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}}}\vert_C\) is injective. This proves the first claim. The second claim follows by iteratively applying the projection defined in \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.3 to obtain the \(2\)-dimensional cylindrical sector cell \(X\).
By definition, \[
X := \{ (x_1,t) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1 \in X', \varphi(x_1) < t < \psi(x_1) \}
\]
where \(\varphi,\psi : X' \to \mathbb{R}\) are continuous definable functions such that \(\varphi(x_1) < \psi(x_1)\) for all \(x_1 \in X'\).
Note that \(X\) may not be bounded from below (resp. above). In this case, we take \(\varphi(x_1) = -\infty\) (resp. \(\psi(x_1) = \infty\)) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in X'\). Functions \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) are either infinite or finite at every point in \(X'\), otherwise, new one-dimensional section cells would exist whose projections onto \(\mathbb{R}^1\) form a proper subset of \(X'\). This would contradict the cylindrical property.
It is clear from this definition that \({\cal I}(c)\) contains a single open interval \((\varphi(c), \psi(c))\), proving the third claim. It follows that \(\gamma\), which consists of the endpoints of intervals in \({\cal I}(c)\), consists of one-dimensional curve intervals which are the graphs of \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) (if finite).

The proof of the final claim is completed by defining the functions \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\).

Since \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1}}}(C)\) is a \((1,\ldots,0,0)\)-cell, it is the graph of a continuous definable map \(\mathbf{h} = (h_1,\ldots,h_{\alpha - 2}) : X' \to \mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 2}\) and \[
C = \{ (\mathbf{x},t) \mid \mathbf{x} \in C', f(\mathbf{x}) < t < g(\mathbf{x})\}
\]
where \(f,g : \mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1} \to \mathbb{R}\) are continuous definable functions such that \(f(\mathbf{x}) < g(\mathbf{x})\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\).
Again, if not bounded from above (resp. below), \(f\) (resp. \(g\)) are taken to be \(-\infty\) (resp. \(\infty\)) at every point.
Observe that the graph of \(f\) (if finite) is the bottom of \(C\) and the graph of \(g\) (if finite) is the top of \(C\).

Writing \(C\) in terms of \(x_1 \in X'\), \(f\), \(g\) and \(\mathbf{h}\), we obtain the functions
\begin{align}
\varphi &:\> C'' \to \mathbb{R}& \psi &:\> C'' \to \mathbb{R}\\
\varphi(x_1) &= f(x_1,\mathbf{h}(x_1)) & \psi(x_1) &= g(x_1,\mathbf{h}(x_1))
\label{eq:phi-psi}
\end{align}
\end{proof}

The refinement is achieved by finding a set of real numbers
\[
(c_1,\ldots,c_t)
\]
such that, for each \(1 \le i < t\),
\[
X \cap \{c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1}\}
\]
is a monotone cell. By \citep[Theorem 1.7]{bgv13}, this can be achieved by ensuring that
\[
\gamma \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1}\}
\]
contains only monotone curve intervals. {[}\citet[Theorem 3.18]{bgv15}.

Applying Corollary \ref{cor:gamma-top-bottom} to \(C\), we obtain continuous definable functions \(\varphi,\psi : X' \to \mathbb{R}\) defining the bottom, \(X_B\), and top, \(X_T\), of \(X\) respectively.
Let \[
(c_1,\ldots,c_t)
\]
such that the graphs of \(\varphi\vert_{\{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}}\) and \(\psi\vert_{\{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}}\) for all \(1 \le i < t\) are monotone curve intervals. By \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 1.7, \(X \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}\) for all \(1\le i < t\) is a semi-monotone set \citep[proof of Lemma 3.18]{bgv15}.
For the graphs of \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) to be monotone curve intervals, we require that \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\) are either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in or independent of \(x_1\). Thus, \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) are the critical points of \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\).
Note that if \(X\) is not bounded from below, then \(\varphi\) does not exist and does not have a graph.
In this case, it is clear that no refinement of \(X_B\) is required.

\hypertarget{sec:lagrange-refinement}{%
\subsection{Finding the critical points of functions phi and psi}\label{sec:lagrange-refinement}}

We now discuss how to find these critical points starting with the polynomials defining cells in \(\cal D\).

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with each set \(V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that every \(2\)-dimensional cell contained in \(V = V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map. Let
\begin{equation}
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_n),
\label{eq:proj-fac-set}
\end{equation}
where \({\cal A}_k \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k], 1 \le k \le n\), be the projection polynomials defining \(\cal D\).
I.e., polynomials in \(\mathcal{A}_k\) have constant sign on every cell in the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\).

Let \(C\) be a \((1,0,\ldots,0,1)\)-cell of the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}\) such that \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}}}^{-1}(C)\) is a \(2\)-dimensional cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) contained in \(V\).
We now describe how to find the numbers \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) such that \(C \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}\) is monotone.

For convenience, we write \(g(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for some \(g \in A_k\) and \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\), such that \(k < n\), if \(g({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(\mathbf{x})) = 0\).
Consider the \((1,0,\ldots,0)\)-cell
\[
C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1}}}(C)
\]
of the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1}\).

Observe that
\[
{\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C) = (a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}
\]
and, since \(C'\) is a section cell, there exist polynomials
\[
g_2 \in {\cal A}_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1} \in {\cal A}_{\alpha - 1}
\] such that \(g_i(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(1\le i \le \alpha - 1\) and \(\mathbf{x} \in (C')\).
Therefore, there exists a one-dimensional algebraic variety
\[
V' := \left\{ g_2(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{\alpha - 1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \right\}
\]
such that \(C' \subset V'\).

Now consider the top of \(C\), denoted by \(C_T\).
By definition, if \(C\) is not bounded from above, then \(C_T\) does not exist. Otherwise, \(C_T\) is the graph of a continuous definable function \(h : C' \to \mathbb{R}\).
In the first case, there is nothing to do.
In the second case, \(C_T\) can be written as
\begin{equation}
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\alpha \mid a < x_1 < b, g_2(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{\alpha - 1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, x_\alpha = h(\mathbf{x}) \},
\label{eq:c-alpha-top}
\end{equation}
where \(\mathbf{x}\) is shorthand for \((x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha)\).
By the construction of \(\cal D\) (e.g., using Proposition \ref{prp:mc-smooth}) \(C_T\) is \(C^\infty\) smooth, therefore \(h\) is a differentiable function everywhere in \(C'\).

This representation lends itself naturally to the problem of optimisation with constraints -- Lagrange multipliers.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:lagrange-multipliers}{}\label{prp:lagrange-multipliers}Let \(f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(g_1,\ldots,g_k : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous functions with continuous first partial derivatives.
Local maxima and minima of \(f\), subject to the constraints \(g_1=0,\ldots,g_k=0\) can be found by computing the critical points of the function
\[
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k) = f(\mathbf{x}) - \lambda_1 g_1(\mathbf{x}) - \cdots - \lambda_k g_k(\mathbf{x}),
\]
where \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and \((\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k) \in \mathbb{R}^k\) are new variables.

Critical points can be found by solving the system of equations
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} - \lambda_1 \dfrac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_i} - \cdots - \lambda_k \dfrac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_i}= 0,
\label{eq:lagrange}
\end{equation}
where \(1\le i \le n-1\),

for \(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
Using variables \((x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha-1})\), constraints \(g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1}\) and function \(h\) from Equation \eqref{eq:c-alpha-top}, the system from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange} can be written in matrix form as follows.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\lambda_{\alpha-2}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

It is clear that, if a solution exists, then the last column
\(\left(\tfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}},\ldots, \tfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}\right)^T\)
will be a linear combination of the first \(\alpha - 1\) columns (in \(g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1}\)).
Hence, optimal values for \((x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha-1})\) exist and satisfy the equation
\begin{equation}
\det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}=0.
\label{eq:jacobi-det}
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det} gives a direct formula to solve Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange} for \(x_1,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1}\). Refinement points \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) are the \(x_1\)-coordinates of these solutions.

Since \(C_T\) is a section cell, there exists a polynomial \(g_\alpha \in {\cal A}_\alpha\) such that \[
C_T := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\alpha \mid {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1}}}(\mathbf{x}) \in C', g_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}.
\] Thus, there exists an algebraic variety
\begin{equation}
V := \left\{ g_2(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{\alpha-1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \right\}
\label{eq:variety-v}
\end{equation}
such that \(C_T \subset V\), where \(g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1}\) are the same polynomials appearing in Equation \eqref{eq:c-alpha-top}.

Note that \(g_\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha]\) -- it is multivariate a polynomial -- while \(h\) from Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det} is expected to be a continuous differentiable function from \(\mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1} \to \mathbb{R}\). In order to use the above construction, we have to be careful only to consider points at which \(g_\alpha\) is differentiable.
In other words, we need to compute derivatives of the implicit function \(g_\alpha\):
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{d x_\alpha}{d x_i} = \dfrac{\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_i}{\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_\alpha}
\label{eq:total-deriv}
\end{equation}
for \(1\le i \le \alpha - 1\).
Let \(J_T\) be the determinant of the matrix of partial derivatives from Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det} with each \(\partial h / \partial x_i, 1 \le i \le \alpha - 1\) replaced with \(d x_\alpha / d x_i\) from Equation \eqref{eq:total-deriv}. Observe that the denominator of \(\partial h / \partial x_i\), for all \(1 \le i \le \alpha - 1\), is equal to
\[d_T := \partial g_\alpha / \partial x_\alpha,\]
so the last column of the matrix, in terms of \(g_\alpha\) is actually
\[
\dfrac{1}{d_T} \left( \partial g_{\alpha} / x_1 , \ldots , \partial g_{\alpha} / x_{\alpha - 1}\right)^T.
\]
This results in the determinant
\[
J_T = \frac{1}{d_T} J'_T,
\]
where \(J'_T\) is the matrix from Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det} with the \(\partial h / \partial x_i\) replaced with \(\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_i\) for \(1\le i \le \alpha - 1\). I.e.,
\begin{equation}
J'_T = \det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \dfrac{\partial g_\alpha}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots &  &  & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial g_{\alpha-1}}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}} & \dfrac{\partial g_\alpha}{\partial x_{\alpha-1}}
\end{pmatrix}=0.
\label{eq:jacobi-det-2}
\end{equation}

Observe that \(J_T\) is a rational function: a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are both polynomials. \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{\alpha - 1}\) is a solution of this rational function if and only if \(J'_T(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) and \(d_T(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0\). Thus, solutions of the system \[
\{ J'_T = 0, d_T \ne 0 \}
\] should be found.
This is clearly a semialgebraic set.
Also note that, when \(\deg(d_T) = 0\), \(d_T\) is a constant and therefore has no solutions. Thus, the condition \(d_T = 0\) can be dropped in this case.

Repeating this process to obtain \(J'_B\) and \(d_B\), if sector cell \(C\) is bounded from below, we have two systems of polynomial equations
\begin{align}
\{ g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha-1}, J'_B \},\\
\{ g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha-1}, J'_T \}
\label{eq:lagrange-solve}
\end{align}
and inequalities
\begin{equation}
\{ s_1 g_{1,1} > 0, \ldots, s_\ell g_{1,\ell} > 0, d_B \ne 0, d_T \ne 0 \}
\label{eq:lagrange-solve-ineqs}
\end{equation}
where \(\{ g_{1,1},\ldots,g_{1,\ell} \} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1]\) are polynomials from \({\cal A}_1\) and \(s_1,\ldots,s_\ell \in \{-1,1\}\) such that \[
X' = (a,b) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}\mid s_1 g_{1,1}(x) > 0, \ldots, s_\ell g_{1,\ell}(x) > 0\}.
\]
We can easily find pairs \((s_j, g_{1,j}) \in \{-1,1\} \times {\cal A}_1\) by considering the sign of the sample point \(c\) of \(X'\) on each polynomial \(g_{1,j} \in {\cal A}_1\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(g_{1,j} > 0\), then \(s_j = 1\).
\item
  If \(g_{1.j}(c) < 0\), then \(s_j = -1\).
\item
  The final case, \(g_{1,j}(c) = 0\), is impossible since an irreducible univariate polynomial cannot be zero over an interval.
\end{itemize}

Perhaps an easier way, if the information available, is to examine the signs of polynomials from \(\mathcal{A}\) on the cell \(X'\). Clearly, if the sign on \(g_j\) is positive, \(s_i = 1\) and if the sign is negative \(s_i = -1\).

For the refinement points \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\), we want to find \(x_1\)-coordinates of the roots of polynomials from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve} subject to the constraints from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-ineqs}.

CAD can, of course, be used to do this, since we are really solving the quantifier elimination problem
\[
\exists x_2,\ldots,x_{\alpha - 1},x_\alpha \mid P(x_1,\ldots,x_\alpha)

Computing the projection onto \(\mathbb{R}^1\) of polynomials \(\{g_2,\ldots,g_{\alpha - 1} J'_B, J'_T \}\) from Equations \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-constraints} and \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-jacobis}, a system
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} := \{ f_1=0 ,\ldots,f_r=0 \} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1]
\label{eq:lagrange-solve-projected}
\end{equation}
is obtained, whose real roots include the refinement points \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\).
Let \({\cal E} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1]\) be the set of polynomials obtained by computing the projection onto \(\mathbb{R}^1\) of \(\{ d_B, d_T \}\) (from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-denominators}) and
\[{\cal G} := \{ s_1 g_{1,1}, \ldots, s_\ell g_{1,\ell} \}
\]
from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs}.
\((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) can be found by computing the real roots of \(\cal F\) subject to the inequalities \(\cal G\), then discarding those such that a polynomial in \(\cal E\) is zero.

It is clear that \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) lie in an open interval \(X' = (a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}\cup \{ -\infty, \infty \}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) (if finite) are section cells. Thus, rather than using strict inequalities from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs}, we could find the roots of \(\cal F\) in the interval \((a,b)\).

Each real root will be represented by a pair
\begin{equation}
c_i := (m_i,J_i)
\label{eq:algebraic-number}
\end{equation}
where \(c_i\) is the unique root of the polynomial \(m_i \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1]\) in the (left-open right-closed) isolating interval \(J_i\).
Note that, being solutions of polynomials, every \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) contains only algebraic numbers and roots will appear in ascending order.

Since this procedure follows the construction described in \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.18, the following has been proved.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:monotone-sector-algorithm}{}\label{prp:monotone-sector-algorithm}Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a sign-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with each set \(V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) with \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_i\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map, for \(1\le i \le k\). Let
\[
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_n),
\]
where \({\cal A}_k \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k], 1 \le k \le n\), be the projection polynomials defining \(\cal D\).

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(\mathcal{D}\) and \(\mathcal{A}\) as input, which produces a set of algebraic numbers \((c_1,\ldots,c_t)\) such that \(C \cap \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{i+1} \}\) is monotone. Each \(c_i, 1 \le i < t\) is represented by a pair \((m_i, J_i) \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1] \times \mathbb{Q}\) (see Equation \eqref{eq:algebraic-number}.
\end{proposition}

\hypertarget{sec:sub-cad}{%
\subsection{Working with sub-decompositions above a 0-cell}\label{sec:sub-cad}}

In the previous section, we considered \((1,0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)\)-cells
However, we will actually be working in a sub-decomposition \(\cal D\) (of \(\mathbb{R}^{k+n}\)) above a \(0\)-cell \(\mathbf{c}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^k\) (\(k \ge 0\)). Therefore the polynomials appearing in Equation \eqref{eq:variety-v} are elements of \(\mathbb{Z}[y_1,\ldots,y_k][x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
From a polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[y_1,\ldots,y_k][x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), a polynomial \(g := f(\mathbf{c}) \in \mathbb{A}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) can be obtained by evaluating \(f\) at \(\mathbf{c}\). Evaluated polynomials \(g\) define the sub-cad of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) above \(\mathbf{c}\) because \(\mathbf{c}\) is a \(0\)-cell.

Note that, since \(\mathbf{c}\) is an algebraic number, \(g\) has algebraic coefficients. Since roots of \(g\) are algebraic numbers, there exists a polynomial \(h \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) such that \(g(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) if and only if \(h(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\). A method for obtaining the polynomial \(h\) with integer coefficients is now described.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If \(f\) is independent of all \(y_1,\ldots,y_k\), there is nothing to do, just set \(h := f\). Otherwise, \(f\) depends on at least one of \(y_1,\ldots,y_k\).
\item
  If \(\mathbf{c}\) is rational, then \(g = f(\mathbf{c})\) has coefficients in \(\mathbb{Q}\). There exists a non-zero \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(h := a g\) has integer coefficients and the same roots as \(g\).
\item
  Otherwise, \(\mathbf{c}\) is not rational. Then \(f(\mathbf{c})\) has coefficients in \(\mathbb{A}\). There exists an algorithm, which takes \(g\) as input and returns a polynomial \(h \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) such that \(g(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) if and only if \(h(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
Let \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a polynomial such that
\[
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \dfrac{a_1}{b_1} m_1 + \cdots + \dfrac{a_k}{b_k} m_k
\]
where \(m_i = x_1^{d_{i,1}} \cdots x_n^{d_{i,n}}\) for \(1 \le i \le k\) is a monomial in \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\).

Let \(M := \operatorname{lcm}(b_1, \ldots, b_k)\) be the least common multiple of denominators and construct
\[
g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = M f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \dfrac{M a_1}{b_1} m_1 + \cdots + \dfrac{M a_k}{b_k} m_k.
\]
Each coefficient in \(g\) will be an integer number since \(M\) is divisible by all \(b_1,\ldots,b_k\) and polynomials \(f\) and \(g\) have the same roots.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:norm}{}\label{def:norm}Let \(K\) be a field and \(L\) a finite (algebraic) extension of \(K\).
The field \(L\) can be thought of as a finite dimensional vector space over \(K\).

Consider \(f\) and \(m\) be polynomials in \(L[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\), viewed as polynomials in \(K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_\alpha]\).
The norm, in \(L[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) of \(f\) can be found by computing the resultant of \(f\) and \(m\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}

Let \(f \in \mathbb{A}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a polynomial such that
\[
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = a_1 m_1 + \cdots + a_k m_k

where \(m_i = x_1^{d_{i,1}} \cdots x_n^{d_{i,n}}\) is a monomial in variables \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\) and \(a_i\) is an element of the algebraic extension of the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) for \(1 \le i \le k\).

Let \(m \in \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]\) be the minimal polynomial for \(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\). \(f\) can be written as a polynomial in \(\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_\alpha]\) and \(m\) can be viewed as a polynomial in \(\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_\alpha]\) which is independent of all \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\). Compute
\[
g := \operatorname{Res}_\alpha (f,m)
\]
to obtain a polynomial in \(\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\). The property that \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) if and only if \(g(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) follows from a property of resultants:

\begin{quote}
Let \(I = \langle f, m \rangle\) be the ideal generated by polynomials \(f, m \in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n][\alpha]\), where \(K\) is an algebraically closed field.
If at least one of \(f\) and \(m\) is monic, then
\[
\operatorname{Res}_\alpha (f,m) \in I \cap R.
\]
\end{quote}

It follows that \(\mathbf{x} \in K^n\) is a common zero of the elements of \(I \cap R\) if and only if it is a zero of \(\operatorname{Res}_\alpha(f,m)\).

\hypertarget{sec:monotone-sections}{%
\section{Two-dimensional monotone sections}\label{sec:monotone-sections}}

Let \(X := {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}}}(C)\) and \((c_1,\ldots,c_r)\) be the refinement points computed in the previous section such that
\[
Y := \{ c_i < x_1 < c_{x+1}\} \cap X,
\]
for some \(1 \le i \le r\), is a two-dimensional monotone sector cell.
Let us return to \citep[Theorem 3.18]{bgv15} to further refine \(Y\) such that every two-dimensional section cell is a monotone cell.

The procedure for computing the refinement of \(Y\) such that \(f_j\) is a monotone function, described in the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.18, proceeds as follows.
Let \(f_j : Y \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}}\) be a component of the quasi-affine map \(\mathbf{f} : X \to \mathbb{R}\). Since \(\mathbf{f}\) is quasi-affine, each component of \(\mathbf{f}\) is quasi-affine and the restriction of component \(f_j\) to \(Y\) is quasi-affine since \(Y \subset X\).
Hence, \(f_j\) is either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in, or independent of each variable \(x_1, x_\alpha\).
In addition, the restriction \(f\vert_{Y \cap \{x_\alpha = c\}}\) for any \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) is either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in, or independent of \(x_\alpha\).
We will compute a refinement of \(Y\) such that \(f_j\vert_Y\) is monotone, each \(B \subset Y\) in the refinement.
As before, only refinements of the kind
\[
\{ x_1 < c \}, \{ x_1 = c \}, \{ x_1 > c \},
\]
\(c \in \mathbb{R}\), which preserves both the cylindrical structure and existing monotone cells will be performed.

\hypertarget{case-1-2-le-j-le-alpha---1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Case 1: \(2 \le j \le \alpha - 1\)}{Case 1: 2 \textbackslash le j \textbackslash le \textbackslash alpha - 1}}\label{case-1-2-le-j-le-alpha---1}}

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone}{}\label{lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone}Let \(Y \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be the graph of a quasi-affine map
\[
\mathbf{f} : (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}
\]
such that \((a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}\). Then \(Y\) is a monotone cell.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider a quasi-affine component \(f_j : (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}\) of the map \(\mathbf{f}\). By definition, \(f_j\) is either strictly increasing in, strictly decreasing in, or independent of \(x_i\). Assume for contradiction that \(Y\) is not monotone and the intersection \(Z := Y \cap \{ x_i = c \}, c \in \mathbb{R}\) is not connected. Since \(Y\) itself is connected, \(Z\) would consist of two isolated points. It is clear that the projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}}}\vert_Y\) is not injective and its image would be one-dimensional (if not, \(f_j\) would be constant and equal to \(c\) and Z would have one connected component).

The proof is completed by applying this argument to each component of the map \(\mathbf{f}\).
\end{proof}

Suppose that \(2 \le j \le \alpha - 1\).
Since
\[
{\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_j,x_\alpha\}}}}(C)
\]
is one-dimensional, connected and the graph of a quasi-affine map, it follows from Lemma \ref{lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone} that \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_j,x_\alpha\}}}}(C)\) is a monotone cell and \(f_j\vert_Y\) is already a monotone function. No refinement is needed.

\hypertarget{case-2-alpha-1-le-j-le-n}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Case 2: \(\alpha + 1 \le j \le n\)}{Case 2: \textbackslash alpha + 1 \textbackslash le j \textbackslash le n}}\label{case-2-alpha-1-le-j-le-n}}

Now suppose that \(\alpha + 1 \le j \le n\).
By \citep[Theorem 3]{bgv13}, if functions \[\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j : {\operatorname{span} \{x_1\}} \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}} \text{ and } \sup_{x_\alpha} f_j : {\operatorname{span} \{x_1\}} \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}}\] are monotone, then \(f_j\) itself is monotone.
Hence, we need to find refinement points
\[
\{ b_1,\ldots,b_r \} \subset (c_i,c_{i+1})
\]
such that, for each \(1\le \ell < r\), the restrictions of both \(\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j\) and \(\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j\) to \(B := \{ b_\ell < x_1 < b_{\ell + 1} \}\) are monotone.

Consider \[
Z := {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_j\}}}}(C).
\]
If \(\dim(Z) < 2\), then it is clear that \(\dim(Z) = 1\), because
\[
Y' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C)
\] is one-dimensional.
It follows that \(\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j\) and \(\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j\) coincide. Since \(Z\) is one-dimensional, connected and the graph of a quasi-affine map, Lemma \ref{lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone} implies that \(f_j\) is already monotone and no refinement is needed.

On the other hand, if \(\dim(Z) = 2\), since \(\mathbf{f}\) is quasi-affine, \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_j\}}}}\vert_C\) is injective.
Let \(Z_T\) be the graph of \(\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j\). Despite the notation, \(Z_T\) is not necesarily the top of \(Z\). In particular, \(Z_T\) may have non-empty intersection with \(Z\).
Since semialgebraic sets are closed under intersection and projection, there exist points
\[\{b_1,\ldots,b_k\} \subset (c_i,c_{i+1})
\] such that for all \(1 \le i < k\) \[
Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T := Z_T \cap \{ b_i < x_1 < b_{i+1} \}
\]
is either a subset of \(Z\) or is disjoint from \(Z\).
First suppose that \(Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T \subset Z\) for some \(1 \le i < k\).
In this case, \(Z\) is not bounded from above, so \(\sup_{x_\alpha} f_j \vert_{\{ b_i < x_1 < b_{i+1} \}}\) is independent of \(x_1\) and is therefore already monotone.
On the other hand, suppose that \(Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T \cap Z = \emptyset\).
In this case, \(Z^{b_i,b_{i+1}}_T \subset {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_j\}}}}(C_T)\).
If there exists a point \(b \in (b_i,b_{i+1})\) such that \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_j\}}}}(C_T) \cap \{x_1 = b\} \cap Z \neq \emptyset\),
then it is clear that \(C_T \cap \{ b_i < x_1 < b_{i+1} \}\) is not the graph of a continuous function.
I.e., \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha,x_j\}}}}(C_T)\) contains an open interval above \((b,y) \in Y_T\).
Since \(\dim(C) = 2\), all these blow-up points \((b,y)\) have dimension \(0\) and therefore there is a finite number of them. Repeating this process for \(\alpha + 1 \le j \le n\), it follows that there exist points
\[\{ b_{i,1}, \ldots, b_{i,k_i} \} \subset (b_i, b_{i+1})
\] such that, for all \(1 \le j < k_i\), \(C_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1} \}\) is the graph of a continuous map.
In particular, \(C_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_i < b_{i,j+1} \}\) is the graph of \(\mathbf{f}\vert_{Y_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1} \}}\).

Apply the same argument to \(\inf_{x_\alpha} f_j\) (for \(C_B\)) so that, \(C_T\) and \(C_B\), if non-empty, are split into one-dimensional continuous curves which are graphs of continuous functions, and the intervals above \(0\)-dimensional blow-up points. Once this property has been satisfied, we are left with a similar construction of optimisation with constraints as in Section \ref{sec:lagrange-refinement}.

\hypertarget{critical-points-of-the-top-and-bottom-of-c}{%
\subsection{Critical points of the top and bottom of C}\label{critical-points-of-the-top-and-bottom-of-c}}

We now discuss how to perform this refinement on the CAD structure. Let us assume that \(C_T\ne \emptyset\), otherwise no refinement is needed. We must construct subsets \(W \subset Y\) such that \(f_j\vert_{W_T}\) is a smooth, continuous function.
Let
\[
{\cal A} = ({\cal A}_1, \ldots, {\cal A}_n)
\]
be the projection factor set as defined in Equation \eqref{eq:proj-fac-set} and
\[
C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{j-1}}}(C), C^j := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{j}}}(C),
\]
Begin with \(j := \alpha+1\) so that \(C'\) is a cylindrical sector cell and there exists an algebraic variety \(V\) containing polynomials \(g_2,\ldots,g_{j-1}\) with each \(g_i \in {\cal A}_i, 2 \le i \le j-1\), defined in Equation \eqref{eq:c-alpha-top}, such that \(C'_T\subset V\).
By definition \[
C^j_T = {\operatorname{cl} \left( C^j \right)} \cap (C'_T \times \mathbb{R})
\] and there exists a polynomial \(g_j \in {\cal A}_j\) such that \(g_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C^j_T\). Since \(C^j_T\) is either empty or the graph of a continuous function everywhere except, possibly, over a finite number of blow-up points, we need to find \(x_1\)-coordinates of points in \(C'_T\) such that \(g_j\) vanishes over an open interval.
Since \(C^j_T\) is one-dimensional, one way to achieve this is by computing a smooth stratification of \(C^j_T\). If the projection of a one-dimensional stratum onto \(x_1\) is a \(0\)-dimensional point \(b \in \mathbb{R}\), then \(b\) is the \(x_1\)-coordinate of a blow-up point.

Alternatively, since the refinement points form a \(0\)-dimensional semialgebraic subset of \(\mathbb{R}\), this set can be represented as a first-order Boolean formula
\[
\exists x_2,\ldots,x_{j-1} \exists_\infty x_j ((x_1,\ldots,x_{j-1}) \in C'_T, g_j(x_1,\ldots,g_j) = 0)
\]
where \(\exists_\infty x\) is a special quantifier defined in \texttt{QEPCAD} meaning ``there exist infinitely many values of \(x\)''.
Using \(\exists_\infty\), some of the costly computations with algebraic numbers can be avoided, thereby improving efficiency in practice \citep{qepcadDocs}.
Theoretically speaking, \citep[Algorithm 14.21]{bpr2006} provides a singly exponential upper bound for quantifier elimination.

Eliminating the \(j-1\) quantifiers, we obtain the desired points \((b_{i,1},\ldots,b_{i,k_i})\), where each \(b_{i,j}\) is the \(x_1\)-coordinate of a blow-up point of \(g_j\).
Now we can assume that \(C^j_T\cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1}\}\) is the graph of a continuous function. More precisely, the implicit function \(g_j\) can be considered as a function from \(C'_T \cap \{ b_{i,j} < x_1 < b_{i,j+1}\}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\). We have a very similar construction as in Section \ref{sec:lagrange-refinement}.
That is, polynomials \(g_2,\ldots,g_{j-1}\) will provide the constraints in the first \(j-2\) columns of the matrix in Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det}, while \(\partial h / \partial x_i, 1 \le i \le j - 1\) in the last column should be replaced with \(\partial g_j / \partial x_i\)
Denote this polynomial by \(J_T\), and repeat with \(C^j_B\) if appropriate. Inequalities \(s_1 g_{1,1} > 0, \ldots, s_1 g_{1,\ell} > 0\) (from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-ineqs}), \(d_T \ne 0\) and \(d_B\) (from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-qe-denominators}) are obtained and solved for \(x_1\) in a very similar way as in Section \ref{sec:lagrange-refinement}. We obtain a set of refinement points
\[
\{ b_{j,1}, \ldots, b_{j,r_j} \} \subset (c_i,c_{i+1})
\]
such that each of \(C^j_T\) and \(C^j_B\) is either empty or the graph of a continuous, monotone function.

The process is completed by induction on \(j\). Suppose that the refinement has been performed for \(\alpha + 1 \le j\). If \(j = n\) we are done, and \(C\) is now monotone. Otherwise, we proceed to \(j+1\). By the induction hypothesis, we know that \(C^{j}_T \cap \{b_{j-1,i} < x_1 < b_{j-1,i+1}\}, 1 \le i < r_{j}\) is either empty or the graph of a continuous (monotone) function.
If \(C^{j}_T = \emptyset\), there is nothing to do as \(C^{j+1}_T\) is empty, too, and the process will terminate.
Otherwise, the new constraint \(g_{j} \in {\cal A}_{j}\) is the polynomial defining \(C^{j}_T\) and \(g_j \in {\cal A}_j\) can be found such that \(g_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C^{j+1}_T\).
Perform the same computation described above, to refine \(C^{j+1}_T\) such that one-dimensional components are graphs of continuous, monotone functions. Repeat with \(C^{j+1}_B\).
As before, a set of refinement points
\[
\{b_{j+1,1}, \ldots, b_{j+1,r_{j+1}}\}
\]
is obtained.

The union of sets of refinement points \[
\{b_{\alpha + 1,1}, \ldots, b_{\alpha + 1,r_{\alpha + 1}}\} \cup \ldots \cup \{b_{n,1}, \ldots, b_{n,r_n}\}
\]
forms the refinement of \(C\) into two-dimensional monotone cells.

Altogether, we have proved the following.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:monotone-section-algorithm}{}\label{prp:monotone-section-algorithm}Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with each set \(V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) with \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_i\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map, for \(1\le i \le k\).

{\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} = \{ c_1,\ldots,c_t \} \subset \mathbb{A}\mid \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-1} \text{ is a } (0,\ldots,0) \text{-cell in the decomposition induced by } {\cal E} \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^k \}
\]
such that, for each \({\cal R}_\mathbf{b}\), intersecting the sub-cad \(\cal D\) above \(\mathbf{b}\) with straight lines and half-planes of the kind \(\{x_1 < c_i \}, \{x_1 = c_i \}, \{x_1 > c_i\}, 1 \le i \le t\) results in a refinement of \(\cal D\) such that each true cell of \(\cal D\) with dimension at most \(2\) is monotone.

First, define a subroutine
\[{\rm sub}_{\mathbf{y}} (g) \mid g \in \mathbb{Z}[y_1,\ldots,y_m,x_1,\ldots,x_n], \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{A}^m, n > 0,\]
which computes \(h := g(\mathbf{y}) \in \mathbb{A}[x_{1},\ldots,x_m]\) and returns the normalised polynomial of \(h\), in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_{m+1},\ldots,x_n]\) (see Section \ref{sec:sub-cad}).

It will be convenient to overload this operator and write \({\rm sub}_{\mathbf{y}} (L)\), where \(L\) is a set (or list) of polynomials to mean \(\{ {\rm sub}_{\mathbf{y}} (g) \mid g \in L \}\).

Now define a structure to store refinement polynomials
\[
{\cal F} := \{ {\cal F}_{\mathbf{b}} := \emptyset \mid \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-1}, k > 0 \text{ is a } (0,\ldots,0) \text{-cell in the decomposition induced by } {\cal E} \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^{k-1} \}
\]
and a similar structure to store refinement points
\[
{\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} := \emptyset \mid \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-1}, k > 0 \text{ is a } (0,\ldots,0) \text{-cell in the decomposition induced by } {\cal E} \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^{k-1} \}
\]
\emph{(Note: for each \((0,\ldots,0)\)-cell \(\mathbf{b}\), \({\cal F}_\mathbf{b}\) is a set of univariate polynomials, \({\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}}\) is the set of roots of polynomials \({\cal F}_\mathbf{b}\). When \(k=1\), then the CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^0\) consisting of the unique point of \(\mathbb{R}^0\) is used -- practically speaking, we work directly with the CAD \(\cal E\).)}

Let \(\mathbf{b}\) be a \((0,\ldots,0)\)-cell of the decomposition induced by \(\cal E\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}, k > 0\). Let \(\cal D\) be the sub-decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) of \(\cal E\) above \(\mathbf{b}\).

Consider each cell \(C\) of \(\cal D\) with truth value \emph{true}. Let \(C\) have index
\[
(0,\ldots,0,1,i_{k+1},\ldots,i_{k+n})
\]
in \(\cal E\). If \(i_{k+1} + \cdots + i_n > 2\), then \(\dim(C) > 2\) and the algorithm will fail. Otherwise, let \(\alpha\) be the smallest among \(x+1,\ldots,k+n\) such that \(i_{k+1} = \ldots = i_{\alpha - 1} = 0\) and \(i_\alpha = 1\).
Then:

      from Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det}, using constraints \(g_{k+1},\ldots,g_{\alpha+1}\), and discarding denominators \(\partial g_\alpha / \partial x_\alpha\) of the total derivatives in the last column.

\section{Correctness and Complexity}\label{correctness-and-complexity-1}}

The correctness of the algorithm from Theorem \ref{thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm} follows from \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 and Lemma 3.19, and is proved in Propositions \ref{prp:monotone-sector-algorithm} and \ref{prp:monotone-section-algorithm}.
The algorithm described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm} considers each \(2\)-dimensional cell in a sub-cad \(\mathcal{E}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) above a \(0\)-dimensional cell \(\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-1}\). This is exactly the inductive step of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20, where an \((i_1,0,\ldots,0,i_{\alpha},0,\ldots,0)\)-cell, where \(i_1 = i_\alpha = 1\), is considered.
By Corollary \ref{cor:gamma-top-bottom} to \(C\), the two-dimensional subset \(X \subset {\operatorname{span} \{x_1,x_\alpha\}}\) is obtained. The first part of \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.18 describes how \(X\) should be refined into two-dimensional semi-monotone sets. The construction described in Section \ref{sec:quasi-affine} explains how to obtain the set of refinement points \((c_1,\ldots,c_t) \subset \mathbb{A}\).
\(C\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map \(\mathbf{f} = (f_{i_1},\ldots,f_{i_{n-2}})\) where each component \(f_j : X \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}}\) for \(j \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{1,\alpha\}\) is a quasi-affine function. The second part of \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.18 describes how to refine \(X\) such that each function \(f_j\) is monotone. By \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.16, if every component \(f_i\) is monotone on a subset in the refinement of \(X\), then the map \(\mathbf{f}\) itself is monotone on that subset of \(X\).
The construction described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-sections} describes how to find the refinement points to ensure that \(\mathbf{f}\) is a monotone map.
Thus, the construction in this section satisfies the properties required in the proof of \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.18 for \(C\) to be monotone.

\hypertarget{sec:monotone-complexity}{%
\subsection{Complexity Analysis}\label{sec:monotone-complexity}}

Let \(C\) be a \((0,\ldots,0,i_j,0,\ldots,0,i_k,0\ldots,0)\)-cell, with \(i_j = i_k = 1\).
The Jacobi determinant, defined in Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det-2}, is computed for all \(k \le \ell \le n\).
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:quasi-complexity}, the determinant of a \((k \times k)\)-matrix of polynomials with maximum degree \(d\) is a polynomial of maximum degree \(kd\).
Also from Section \ref{sec:quasi-complexity}, the complexity of computing the CAD with quasi-affine cells is
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}},
\]
which, according to Proposition \ref{prp:collins}, is also an upper bound on the number of polynomials, their degree and the number of cells in this CAD.
Thus, the degree of the polynomial defined in Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det} is at most \(n\cdot(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}\), which is asymptotically the same as
\((s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}\).

We then compute the \(x_1\)-coordinates of the solutions to the \(0\)-dimensional system of equations (defined in Equations \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve}), subject to the inequalities (defined in Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-ineqs}). In the implementation, CAD projection is used to compute a family of polynomials \({\cal F}\), defined in Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve-projected}, such that the required refinement points contain their roots.
As we are well aware, the number of polynomials and their degrees will be doubly exponential in \(n\). However, a better bound on the number of refinement points can be obtained.
Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve} defines two systems of \(\alpha - 1\) equations in \(\alpha - 1\) unknowns and both systems have a finite number of solutions.
A generalisation of Bezout's Theorem (see \citet{masser1983}) states that, over an algebraically closed field, if a system of \(n\) polynomial equations, having degrees \(d_1,\ldots,d_n\), in \(n\) unknowns has a finite number of solutions, then this number, counted with multiplicities, is at most the product \(d_1 \cdots d_n\). This will be an upper bound on the number of different real solutions to the system of polynomials. Since we only have an upper bound on the maximum degree \(d\) of polynomials appearing in the systems from Equation \eqref{eq:lagrange-solve}, then there are at most \(d^n\) distinct real solutions to the system.
An even tighter bound can be obtained by considering the number of connected components of the algebraic set defined by this system of equations.
Indeed, the number of connected components of a definable set is given by the \(0\)-th Betti number, \(b_0\), of the set.
\citet{gv2009} Section 6.1 present some bounds on the total Betti number -- sum of Betti numbers of all orders -- \({\tt{b}}(S)\) of a semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\).
For a semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) defined by a conjunction of any number of polynomials having maximum degree \(d\), \({\tt{b}}(S) \le d(2d - 1)^{n-1}\) \citep[Section 6.1 (a)]{gv2009}.
This bound is sufficient for our situation because the inequalities define a subset of these roots.
Using the upper bound on the degrees of polynomials defining the CAD and the determinant of the matrix, along with the bound on the number of roots given by Bezout's theorem, we get a bound for the number of refinement points of
\[
\left(s(d+1)\right)^{n \cdot O(1)^{n}}.
\]
This is asymptotically the same as
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]

For the cell \(C\), this process is repeated at most \(2(n-2)\) times, and then repeated for each \(2\)-dimensional cell in the CAD contained in the input set \(V\).
There are at most
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}
\]
cells in total, which is obviously an upper bound on the cells of dimension \(2\). Thus, we get an upper bound on the number of refinement points of
\[
\left((s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}\right)^2
\]
which is asymptotically the same as
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]
Thus, we obtain a bound on the total number of refinement points, which is asymptotically the same as the bound on the number of cells in the CAD containing quasi-affine cells. This gives us an upper bound on the complexity, number of cells, number of polynomials and degrees defining a CAD which is monotone with respect to all \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\).

\hypertarget{sec:compute-refinement}{%
\section{Computing the refinements}\label{sec:compute-refinement}}

We now describe how to refine the CAD \(\cal D\) to be compatible with the refinement points in \(\cal R\).

For \(0 \le k \le n\), consider each refinement point \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_{k-1}, c_k) \in {\cal R}_k\). It is important to note that refinement points appear in ascending order.
Let \({\cal D}'\) be the sub-cad of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-k}\) above \((c_1,\ldots,c_k)\), which is a \((0,\ldots,0)\)-cell of the CAD induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\) and let \({\cal D}''\) be the CAD induced by \({\cal D}'\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\). We want to refine \({\cal D}''\) such that \(\mathbf{c}\) is a new \((0)\)-cell.
We need only to consider coordinate \(k+1\) of \(\mathbf{c}\). Denote it by \(c_{k+1}\).
For each \((0)\)-cell \(b_{k+1}\) of \({\cal D}''\), compute \(s := \operatorname{sign}(b_{k+1} - c_{k+1})\). If \(s \le 0\), consider the next \((0)\)-cell in \({\cal D}''\). Otherwise, \(s > 0\) and there is a \((1)\)-cell \(C\) in \({\cal D}''\) such that \(c_{k+1} \in C\). This is the cell we need to refine.
Make two new copies of \(C\), so that we have three identical cells \(C_1,C_2,C_3\). Recall that, to each cell belongs a sample point and possibly some other information. E.g., in QEPCAD, each cell has a set of signs of projection factors, which should remain unchanged, and a positional index which describes where in the CAD the cell can be found. Let \(C_1\) have positional index \((j_1,\ldots,j_k,j_{k+1})\). New cells \(C_2\) and \(C_3\) should have positional indices \((j_1,\ldots,j_k,j_{k+1} + 1\) and \((j_1,\ldots,j_k,j_{k+1}+2)\) respectively. For each existing cell with positional index \((l_1,\ldots,l_k,l_{k+1})\) with \(l_k+1 > j_{k+1}\), the index should be updated to \((l_1,\ldots,l_k,l_{k+1} + 2)\). We now need to update the sample points. The sample point of the section cell \(C_2\) should be \(\mathbf{c}\). This might turn out to be the case by chance. In this case, there is nothing to be done with \(C_2\) and the sample points of sector cells \(C_1\) and \(C_3\) are incorrect. Otherwise, \(\mathbf{c}\) is either greater than the sample point of \(C_1\), in which case the sample point of \(C_1\) is already correct, or \(\mathbf{c}\) is less than \(C_3\), in which case the sample point of \(C_3\) is already correct. I.e., in every case, exactly two of the sample points of the cells \(C_1\), \(C_2\) and \(C_3\) must be updated.
Let \(C\) be the open interval \((a_1,a_2)\). If the sample point of \(C_1\) needs to be updated, then set it to \((a_1 + c_{k+1}) / 2\) and if the sample point of \(C_3\) needs updating, then set it to \((c_{k+1} + a_2) / 2\). Observe that, if we have updated the sample point of a cell \(C\), then the sample points of every cell which projects on \(C\) are now incorrect.
Since polynomials are delineable over the original cell, then they will be delineable over the smaller cells in the refinement, so we simply need to run the sample point computation part of the lifting phase recursively on the stack above \(C\). This involves evaluating each level \(k+1\) projection factor \(f\) at the new sample point \(\mathbf{b}\) and finding the roots of the (possibly algebraic) univariate polynomial \(f(\mathbf{b},x_n)\).

Repeating this process with each refinement point in \(\mathbf{R}_k\), we obtain the refinement described in \citep[Lemma 3.11]{bgv15}.

\hypertarget{sec:frontier}{%
\chapter{Frontier Condition}\label{sec:frontier}}

Suppose we have a CAD \(\cal D'\) monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2, 1 \le i \le k\).
The algorithm from Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm} produces such a CAD, which is also sign-invariant on a set of
polynomials \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\). It is clear that \(\mathbf{F}\) should contain the polynomials in
defining formulas for sets \(V_i\), along with some additional polynomials which ensure that each cell \(C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\) is monotone.
In this section, we describe how to refine \(\mathcal{D'}\) in order that it satisfies the frontier condition. A refinement, \(\mathcal{D''}\) of \(\mathcal{D'}\) satisfies the frontier condition if \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D''}\), for each cell \(C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\) of \(\mathcal{D''}\) (Definition \ref{def:frontier-condition}).

We first present a motivating example due to \citet{jhd20}.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:whitney-jhd}{}\label{exm:whitney-jhd}\citep[Example 2.1]{jhd20}

Let \(f := y^2 - x^2 z\) and observe that \(f(0,0,z) = 0, z \in \mathbb{R}\), i.e., \(f\) ``blows up'' above the origin. Let \(\Delta := \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid 0 < x < 1, -x < y < x \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2\) and let
\[
W := \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid (x,y) \in \Delta, f(x,y,z) = 0 \}.
\]
Consider \({\operatorname{fr} \left( W \right)}\), which can be expressed as the disjoint union of four basic semialgebraic sets:
\begin{align}
{\operatorname{fr} \left( W \right)} =&\ \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, y = x, z = 1 \} \\
\cup&\ \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, y = -x, z = 1 \} \\
\cup&\ \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x = 1, -1 < y < 1, z = y^2 \} \\
\cup&\ \{ (0,0,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 \le z \le 1 \}.
\label{eq:jhd-whitney-blow-up}
\end{align}
Due to the blow-up point above the origin, \({\operatorname{fr} \left( W \right)}\) contains the subset \(B := \{ (0,0,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 \le z \le 1 \}\) (from Equation \eqref{eq:jhd-whitney-blow-up}).

A CAD having constant sign on the polynomials
\[
\{ x, x - 1, x + y, x - y, y^2 - x^2 z \}
\] defining \(W\) will not contain the blow-up subset \(B\), because two additional polynomials, \(z\) and \(z-1\), are needed to define it.
\end{example}

It is clear from Example \ref{exm:whitney-jhd} that a sign-invariant CAD may not always be sufficient to construct a CAD with frontier condition. \citet{pianomovers1983} proved that it is always possible to construct a sign-invariant CAD which satisfies the frontier condition if a linear rotation of coordinates is permitted. \citet{jhd20} also proved that a sign-invariant CAD will always satisfy the frontier condition if polynomials containing blow-up points are not allowed. In the following sections, we discuss what to do when a rotation of coordinates is not permitted and when blow-up points may be present.

Note that \(W\), from Example \ref{exm:whitney-jhd}, is a \((1,1,0)\)-cell, but it is not monotone. In fact, \(W\) is not even the graph of a quasi-affine map, since \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x,z\}}}}(W)\) is two-dimensional, but the projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x,z\}}}}\vert_W\) is not injective. The blow-up subset \(B\), contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( W \right)}\) means that \(W\) is not a topologically regular cell, since \({\operatorname{fr} \left( ( \right)}W)\) is not homeomorphic to a circle.
In the procedures described in the following sections, due to \citet{bgv15} and \citet{lazard10}, the cells on which the frontier condition is to be satisfied must be topologically regular cells.

\hypertarget{sec:frontier-bgv}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Construction of a CAD with frontier condition due to \citet{bgv15}}{Construction of a CAD with frontier condition due to @bgv15}}\label{sec:frontier-bgv}}

Given the monotone CAD \(\mathcal{D'}\) computed in the algorithm from Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm}, our final step, according to \citep[Theorem 3.20]{bgv15} is to compute a refinement \(\mathcal{D''}\) of \(\mathcal{D'}\) such that the frontier \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} = {\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)} \setminus C\) of every cell \(C \subset V = V_1\cup \ldots, \cup V_k\) is a union of cells of \(\cal D''\).

The construction from \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 proceeds as follows. For each \(2\)-dimensional cell \(C \subset V\), consider the semialgebraic set \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\). Since \(C\) is monotone, we can assume that \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is homeomorphic to a circle. Construct a partition \(\cal U\) of \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) into monotone one-dimensional curves and points, such that \(\cal U\) is compatible with all one-dimensional cells of \(\cal D'\).
Let \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_n)\) be one of the one-dimensional components of \(\cal U\). If \(c_1\) is not a \(0\)-dimensional cell of the decomposition induced by \(\cal D'\) on \(\mathbb{R}^1\), then perform a refinement of the kind \(x_1 < c_1, x_1 = c_1, x_1 > c_1\). Recall that these refinements, according to \citep[Lemma 3.11]{bgv15}, preserve the cylindrical structure and monotone cells. Otherwise, \(c_1\) is a \(0\)-cell and we apply the same argument to the sub-CAD of \(\cal D'\) above \(c_1\).

Now let \(T \in {\cal U}\) be one of the one-dimensional components. If \(T\) is not an existing 1-dimensional cell of \(\cal D'\), then it is a subset of a 2-dimensional cell \(Z\) of \(\cal D'\). In fact, it divides \(Z\) into two cells \(Z \setminus T\), both of which, according to \citep[Theorem 11]{bgv13}, are 2-dimensional monotone cylindrical cells. Hence, replacing \(Z\) by \(T\) and the two monotone connected components of \(Z \setminus T\) makes \(Z\) compatible with \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\), while the refinement of \(Z\) consists of only monotone cells.

Repeating this process for each \(0\)- and \(1\)-dimensional component of \(\cal U\), we obtain a refinement of \(\cal D'\) compatible with \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\).
This completes the construction of a cylindrical decomposition \(\mathcal{D''}\) satisfying the frontier condition and monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set of dimension at most two \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\).

The most computationally difficult part of implementing this construction is computing \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\).

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:frontier}{}\label{lem:frontier}Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F\)
containing \(s\) different polynomials in \(\mathbb{R}[x_1, \ldots ,x_n]\) having maximum degree \(d\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(F\) as input, which represents the semialgebraic set \({\operatorname{fr} \left(  S  \right)}\) by a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F'\) with complexity
\[(sd)^{O(n^2)}.
\]
This is also an upper bound on the number of polynomials in \(F'\) and their degrees.
\end{lemma}

Lemma \ref{lem:frontier} is proved and discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:novel-frontier-fr}.
The ``obvious'' way of computing the frontier involves solving a quantifier elimination problem with two quantifier alternations. Using an efficient algorithm, e.g., \citep[Algorithm 14.21]{bpr2006}, this procedure has complexity singly exponential in the number of variables. \(\partial C\) is represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F\).

Once \({\operatorname{fr} \left( ( \right)}C)\) has been computed, we first construct the family \(\cal U\) of one-dimensional curve intervals \(T\) and the points between them \(\mathbf{c}\). By Lemma \ref{lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone}, one-dimensional quasi-affine cells are always monotone. Thus, we may apply the method described in Section \ref{sec:quasi-affine} to obtain Jacobi matrices whose determinants are zero at the critical points of projections onto one and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces.
If CAD with the McCallum projection operator is used to solve the QE problem, then each smooth 1-dimensional cell \(D\) in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) will be defined by \(n-1\) polynomials. We refine \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) to be compatible with the critical points of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}}}(D), 1\le i \le n\) defined by \(\det(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\}\setminus \{i\}}) = 0\).

A further refinement of each one-dimensional component \(T\) of \(\cal U\) to be compatible with existing cells of \(\cal D'\) may also be required.
For each one-dimensional component \(T \in {\cal U}\) and each one-dimensional cell \(D\) of \(\cal D'\), consider \(E := T \cap D\) such that \(E \ne \emptyset\).
If \(E \subset D\), then \(T\) should be split into one-dimensional components \(E\) and \(\int(T \setminus E)\) and the zero-dimensional endpoints of \(E\). This makes \(\cal U\) compatible with all cells of the CAD \(\cal D'\).

Consider each \(T \in {\cal U}\) which is a subset of a 2-dimensional cell \(Z\). The refinement can be performed exactly as described by \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20. I.e., partition \(Z\) into \(Z_1 \cup T \cup Z_2\) where \(Z_{1,B}=Z_B\) and \(Z_{1,T} = T\) and \(Z_{1,B}=Z_T\) and \(Z_{1,T} = Z_T\).

Now consider the zero-dimensional components \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_n)\) of \(\cal U\). Refinements of \(\cal D\) to be compatible with \(\mathbf{c}\) again proceed as described by \citet{bgv15}. I.e., Consider \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(C)\) such that \(C'\) is zero-dimensional and equal to \((c_1,\ldots,c_k)\), but \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k+1}}}(C)\) is one-dimensional. Perform a refinement of the sub-cad above \((c_1,\ldots,c_k)\) by intersecting it with \(\{ x_k < c_k \}, \{ x_k = c_k \}, \{ x_k > c_k \}\) -- the refinements defined in \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.11. Repeat until \((c_1,\ldots,c_n)\) is a cell in the refinement.

Let \(\cal D''\) be the refinement of \(\cal D'\), compatible with \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) for all 2-dimensional cells \(C\) of \(\cal D'\). This CAD is compatible with, and monotone with respect to all \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), and the frontier of each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup \ldots V_k\) of \(\cal D''\) is the union of some other cells of \(\cal D''\) of smaller dimension.
\(\cal D''\) satisfies the frontier condition, so the construction is complete.

We have proved that the following algorithm exists, and will discuss its complexity later.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:lazard-rn}{}\label{thm:lazard-rn}Let \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be a set of \(s\) polynomials with maximum degree \(d\).
Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), compatible with some bounded definable semialgebraic sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), which \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_i\) is monotone.

Then there is an algorithm, taking \(\mathcal{D}\) as input, which produces a refinement \(\mathcal{D'}\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k\) of \(\mathcal{D'}\) satisfies the frontier condition.
This algorithm has complexity
\[
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{2^{O(n)}},
\]
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

\section{Lazard's method for dimension not greater than 3}\label{sec:lazard-3}}

The method described in Section \ref{sec:frontier-bgv} is relatively straightforward as it relies on techniques we have used before (obtaining quasi-affine subsets and performing refinements). However, we may want to find an alternative method, so as to avoid the QE required to compute the frontiers of \(2\)-dimensional cylindrical cells.
In the following section, we will explore an alternative method to obtain the frontier condition, based on an algebraic construction described by \citet{lazard10}.

\citet{lazard10} presents an algorithm for constructing an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant cylindrical algebraic decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n, n\le 3\) such that every cell is a topologically regular cell and the frontier condition is satisfied.
Lazard refers to a decomposition having these properties as a ``strong'' decomposition.

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:laz-properties}{}\label{def:laz-properties}

\citep[Definition 2.7]{lazard10}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A cylindrical cell \(C\) is boundary smooth if the intersection with \(C\) of every small open ball centred on the boundary of \(C\) is connected
\item
  A \(k\)-dimensional cylindrical cell is well-bordered if \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is the closure of some \(k-1\)-dimensional cylindrical cells.
\item
  A cylindrical cell \(C\) is boundary coherent if \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is a union of cells.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\citep[Definition 2.7]{lazard10}

These properties can be extended from cells to the whole CAD. I.e., a CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) is called well-bordered (resp. boundary coherent, boundary smooth) if every cell in \(\mathcal{D}\) is well-bordered (resp. boundary coherent, boundary smooth).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
If a cylindrical cell satisfies Property 2 of Definition \ref{def:laz-properties} (boundary smooth) then it is a topologically regular cell.

Property 3 of Definition \ref{def:laz-properties} (boundary coherent) is the frontier condition (see Definition \ref{def:frontier-condition}).
\citet{jhd20} call this property closure finiteness.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 2.7]{lazard10}

A CAD is called ``strong'' if every cell is boundary smooth, well-bordered and boundary coherent.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\citep[Definition 4.1]{lazard10}

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(\mathcal{D'}\) be the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). A cell \(C'\) of \(\mathcal{D'}\) is called ``bad'' if there is a polynomial \(f \in \mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) such that \(f\) is primitive and has positive degree in \(x_n\) and \(f(\mathbf{x})\), for all \(\mathbf{x} \in C'\) vanishes over an open interval. Every point \(\mathbf{x}\) in the bad cell \(C'\) is a blow-up point of the polynomial \(f\) (see Definition \ref{def:blow-up-point}).
\end{definition}

According to \citet{lazard10}, Corollary 4.7, in dimension \(\le 2\), there is nothing to do as Collins' algorithm already produces these ``strong'' decompositions.
For a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^3\), the process proceeds in three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Obtain well-bordered cells
\item
  Obtain boundary smooth cells
\item
  ``Lift above bad points'' to satisfy the frontier condition.
\end{enumerate}

First, we must ensure that every cell is well-bordered. The following result shows that this is already the case for sign-invariant decompositions of \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

\begin{corollary}
\protect\hypertarget{cor:lazard-5-4}{}\label{cor:lazard-5-4}\citep[Corollary 5.4]{lazard10}

Every \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n, n \le 3\) is well-bordered.
\end{corollary}

Corollary \ref{cor:lazard-5-4} follows from \citet{lazard10}, Lemma 5.1 and Theorem 5.3.
The former asserts that every \(0\)- and \(1\)-dimensional cell in a CAD of arbitrary dimension is well-bordered.
The latter asserts that any cell in an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^3\), such that the decomposition \(\mathcal{D}'\) induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is strong, is well-bordered.
Note that \(\mathcal{D}'\) is a \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}}(\mathbf{F})\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and is always strong by \citet{lazard10}, Corollary 4.7.
\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.2 depends on the following result.

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:lazard-5-2}{}\label{lem:lazard-5-2}\citep[Proposition 5,2]{lazard10}

Let \(\cal D\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(\cal D'\) the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). Let \(C\) be a cell of \(\cal D\) and \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}} (C)\) such that \(C'\) is well-bordered.
If \(p \in {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\), then \(I := (p \times \mathbb{R}) \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is connected.
\(I\) is therefore a point or a closed segment, either bounded or unbounded.
Furthermore, if \(C\) is a sector cell, then the set of points of \(I\) which do not belong to the boundaries of the section cells delineating \(C\) is either empty or an open interval.
\end{lemma}

\citet{lazard10}, Theorem 5.12 describes how to pass from a well-bordered, \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to one in which every cell is boundary smooth. This is done by refining \(\mathcal{D}\) such that it has constant sign on some new polynomials. This refinement contains only well-bordered, topologically regular cells.
The construction of a CAD with monotone cells described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-cells} also satisfies these properties, if we limit ourselves to \(n\le3\). Indeed, the algorithm from Section \ref{sec:quasiaffine-algorithm} returns a CAD with constant sign on \(\mathbf{F'}\), the set of input polynomials and the additional polynomials added to ensure that every cell is smooth and the graph of a quasi-affine map. Hence, every cell in this CAD is well-bordered. The algorithm for obtaining monotone cells, described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm} requires us to compute refinements of the kind \(\{ x_1 < c \}, \{ x_1 = c \}, \{ x_1 > c \}\) of a \((1)\)-cell \(C'\) in the sub-decomposition above a 0-dimensional cell.
This refinement is also applied to every cell \(C\) in this sub-decomposition such that \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{1}}}(C)\). Thus, the refined CAD is sign invariant on \(\mathbf{F'}\) and the cells \(C\) projecting on \(C'\) are sign-invariant with respect to polynomials \(x_1 - c\), defining each refinement point \(c\).
Cells which were not refined are either already monotone or lie outside of the input sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\).
As a result, we are able to apply Lazard's method for lifting with bad points to the CAD produced by the algorithm from Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm}.

\citet{lazard10}, Section 5.3 describes how to pass from an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) such that every cell is well-bordered and boundary smooth to one satisfying the frontier condition.
By \citet{lazard10}, Theorem 4.4, a cell \(C\) already satisfies the frontier condition if no points in its frontier project on a bad cell (see also \citet{jhd20}).
Thus, only cells which fail to satisfy this property need to be considered. By \citet{lazard10}, Lemma 4.3, in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), if a bad cell exists, then it has dimension \(0\).

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:only-bad-zero-cells}{}\label{lem:only-bad-zero-cells}\citep[Lemma 4.3]{lazard10}

A sign-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) contains no bad cells.

For an \(\mathbf{F} \subset \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3]\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^3\), if the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) contains a bad cell, then it is a \((0,0)\)-cell.
\end{lemma}

This follows from the fact that, in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), a blow-up point of a polynomial in \(\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) has codimension at least two (see Remark aftor Definition \ref{def:blow-up-point}).

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:no-blow-up}{}\label{lem:no-blow-up}\citep[Theorem 4.4]{lazard10}

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(C\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) with \(C' := \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}(C)\). If the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is strong and none of \(C'\) and any cell \(D'\) such that \(D' \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)} \ne \emptyset\) is bad, \(C\) is well-bordered, boundary smooth and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is a union of some cells of \(\mathcal{D}\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This result follows from the following fact about roots of multivariate polynomials: given a polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]\), i.e., considered as a univariate polynomial with polynomial coefficients, its complex roots depend continuously on the parameters in the region of the parameter space where the polynomial does not vanish identically. In fact, this is only true in the projective closure of \(\mathbb{C}\) as some roots may pass through the point at infinity if the leading coefficient is zero.

First suppose that \(C\) is a section cell. I.e., it is a root of some polynomial \(f\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is defined as the limit of this root over the boundary of \(C'\). Thus \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}\) is a continuous, injective map from \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) to \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\). This follows from the assumption that the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is strong and that if the root defining the section \(C\) is infinite over some cell \(C'' \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\), then it is also infinite over \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C'' \right)}\).

Now suppose that \(C\) is a sector cell. If nonempty, the top \(C_T\) and bottom \(C_B\) of \(C\) are section cells. We complete the proof by describing \(W := {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} \setminus (C_T \cup C_B)\).
We will only consider the case where \(C \cap \{ \mathbf{x} \times \mathbb{R}\}\) is an open interval bounded from below by a point in \(C_B\) and above by a point in \(C_T\).

Let \(\dim(C) = d + 1\). \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) consists of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the cells in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_B \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_T \right)}\), which have dimension \(< d\) and are contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)} \times \mathbb{R}\),
\item
  the intervals (which may be empty) bounded by the points in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_B \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_T \right)}\), contained in \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\). Since \(C_B\) and \(C_T\) are section cells, they are roots of polynomials \(f\) and \(g\) and, if finite, the points in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_B \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_T \right)}\) are also roots of \(f\) and \(g\) (respectively). Therefore, these intervals are contained in some cells of \(\cal D\). More precisely, the cells with dimension \(d\) contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)} \times \mathbb{R}\) are exactly those lying over a cell \(C'' \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) with dimension \(d-1\).
\end{itemize}

A cell of dimension \(< d\) either belongs to \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_B \right)}\) or \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_T \right)}\), or is a sector over a cell \(D \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) having dimension less than \(d-1\).
As \(C'\) is well-bordered, \(D\) belongs to the boundary of some cell \(E \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) having dimension \(d-1\).
Thus, the sector above \(D\) is contained in the boundary of the sector above \(E\), which has dimension \(d\)

This proves that, if the decomposition induced by \(D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is strong, then \(C\) is well-bordered and also satisfies the frontier condition. In addition, this proves that \(C\) is a topologically regular cell as \(C\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) are either homeomorphic to \(C'\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\), if \(C\) is a sector cell, or to an open cylinder, either bounded or unbounded, and its boundary. It is clear that an open cylinder contained in \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\), where \(C'\) is topologically regular, is also topologically regular.

The other cases are deduced by omitting the cells defined from \(C_B\) and \(C_T\) as appropriate.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:lazard-5-13}{}\label{lem:lazard-5-13}

\citep[ Proposition 5.13]{lazard10}
Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and \(C\) be a well-bordered, boundary smooth cell of \(\mathcal{D}\).
Suppose that \(D\) is a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that \(B := D \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left(  C  \right)} \neq \emptyset\) and \(B \neq D\). Then either

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(C\) is a \(1\)-dimensional section cell whose endpoint, \(B\), projects on a bad cell, or
\item
  there exists a cell \(E\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that \(\dim(E) < \dim(C)\) and \(\emptyset \neq D \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left(  E  \right)} \neq D\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

By the proof of \citet{lazard10}, Theorem 4.4, \(D\) will always be a \((0,0,1)\)-cell in the cylinder above a bad cell \(D'\).

Consider each case for \(C\) by cell index.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \((1,1,1)\)-cell: since \(C\) is well-bordered, its boundary is the closure of some 2-dimensional cells of \(\cal D\) and \(B\) is contained in the union of the boundaries of the 2-cells. Thus, case 2 applies and we can choose an appropriate 2-dimensional cell in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) for \(E\).
\item
  \((1,0,1)\)- or \((0,1,1)\)-cell, we write \((i,j,1)\)-cell where \(i+j=1\): observe that \(C\) (if bounded) is delineated by some \((i,j,0)\)-cells (one-dimensional curve intervals). Take \(B\) to be the one-dimensional interval delineated by the endpoints of these cells. Since \(B \neq C\), at least one of these endpoints is not a \((0,0,0)\)-cell of \(\cal D\). Case 2 applies, taking as \(E\) the delineating \((i,j,0)\)-cell.
\item
  \((1,0,0)\)- or \((0,1,0)\)-cells: consider the previous case, letting \(C = E\).
\item
  \((1,1,0)\)-cell: these are necessarily the root of a polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3]\) which vanishes identically on \(D'\), a \((0,0)\) cell in the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
  Let \(V_r\) be a small neighbourhood (with radius \(r > 0\)) centred around \(D'\) and consider \(V_r'\), the cylinder above the boundary of \(V_r\). Since \(C\) is a monotone cell, the maximum and minimum values of \(x_3\) in this intersection are reached on the boundary of \(C\), for sufficiently small \(r\). The limits, as \(r\) tends to \(0\), of this maximum and minimum clearly belong to the boundary of \(B\), if these limits do not tend to infinity. Note that both the maximum and minimum cannot be infinite, since this would imply that either \(B\) is empty, or coincides with \(D\). Therefore, the non-infinite limits are the endpoints of some \(1\)-dimensional cell belonging to the boundary of \(C\). Case 2 applies, taking \(E\) to be this \(1\)-dimensional cell.
\item
  \((0,0,1)\)- or \((0,0,0)\)-cells: don't satisfy the hypothesis, there is nothing to do.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

The following result shows how \((0,0,1)\)-cells which project on a bad point can be refined to obtain the frontier condition.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:lazard-5-14}{}\label{prp:lazard-5-14}\citep[Proposition 5.14]{lazard10}
Let \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3]\) be an irreducible polynomial of the kind
\[f = g_dx_3^d + \ldots + g_1x_3 + g_0\]
with each \(g_i \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2]\), and
\[\mathbf{p} = (p_1,p_2)\]
be a common root of \(g_d,\ldots,g_1,g_0\).
Let \(g\in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2]\) be an irreducible polynomial having \(\mathbf{p}\) as a root.
The limits of the common roots of \(f\) and \(g\) as \((x_1, x_2) \to \mathbf{p}, (x_1, x_2) \ne \mathbf{p}\) may be computed as solutions of a zero-dimensional
polynomial system.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since \(f\) is irreducible, it has at least two coefficients, \(g_i,g_j \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2]\), whose GCD is a constant.
Therefore, any ideal generated by these coefficients has dimension zero. Any ideal containing these coefficients also contains another element, \(h\), which is not a multiple of \(g\).

The saturation by \(h\) of the ideal \(\langle f,g \rangle\) is defined as the ideal
\[
S := \langle f, g, 1 - zh \rangle \cap \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3].
\]
The irreducible components of the zero set of \(S\) are those of the zero set of \(\langle f,g \rangle\) at which \(h\) is not identically zero. It follows that the vertical line \(\{ x_1 = p_1, x_2 = p_2 \}\) which is part of the zero set of \(f\) ,\(g\) and \(h\), is not contained in the zero set of \(S\). Meanwhile, the zero set of \(S\) contains the limit points we are interested in finding.

Therefore, the ideal generated by \(S\) and the coefficients \(g_0,\ldots,g_d\) of \(f\) is zero-dimensional and the limits of \(\{ f=0,g=0 \}\) as \((x_1,x_2) \to \mathbf{p}\) can be computed as the zeros of \(S\).
\end{proof}

The proof of \citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.14 depends on taking Zariski closures. These are now defined and a relevant property presented, closely following \citet{cox2013}.

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:cox-zariski}{}\label{prp:cox-zariski}\citep[ p203, part of Theorem 10]{cox2013}
Let \(I,J \subset K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be ideals, then
\({\operatorname{cl} \left(  V(I) \setminus V(J)  \right)} \subset V(I : J^\infty)\),
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We claim that \(I \subset I:J \subset I:J^\infty \subset I(V(i0) \setminus V(J))\). We have \(I \subset I:J \subset I:J^2 \subset \cdots \subset I:J^\infty\) by the ascending chain condition.
Suppose that \(f \in I:J\infty\) and \(a \in V(I) \setminus V(J)\). Then \(fg^N \in I\) for all \(g \in J\) and a suitable (large enough) \(N\ge 0\). Since \(a \in V(I)\), \(f(a)g^N(a) = 0\) (for all \(g\in J\) and large enough \(N\)). Since \(a \not \in V(J)\), there exists \(f \in J\) and \(N \ge 0\) such that \(g(a) \ne 0\). Hence \(f(a) = 0\) for all \(a \in V(I) \setminus V(J)\). We have \(f \in I(V(I) \setminus V(J))\). Transitivity of \(\subset\) proves the claim. Since \(V\) reverses inclusion, we have \(= {\operatorname{cl} \left(  V(i) \setminus V(J)  \right)} = V(I(V(i) \setminus V(J))) \subset V(I:J^\infty)\).
\end{proof}

The proof of \citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.14 begins with an irreducible polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3]\), such that there exists a \((1,1,0)\)-cell \(C \subset \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}\), a point \(\mathbf{p} = (p_1,p_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2\) such that \(\mathbf{p}\) is a blow-up point of \(f\) and \(g \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2]\) such that \(g(\mathbf{p}) = 0\).
Consider the variety \(V(\langle f \rangle + \langle g \rangle ) = V(f) \cap V(g)\), which contains some of the one-dimensional cells which form part of \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) and the blow-up subset \(B \subset \mathbf{p} \times \mathbb{R}\).
The saturation by \(h\) of \(I\),
\[
S := \langle f, g, 1 - zh \rangle \cap \mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3]
\]
is constructed.
By Proposition \ref{prp:cox-zariski} (\citet{cox2013}, Theorem 10),
\[
{\operatorname{cl} \left(  V(\langle f,g \rangle) \setminus V(\langle h \rangle)  \right)} \subset S.
\]
Since our blow-up point \(\mathbf{p}\) is \(0\)-dimensional, computing this Zariski closure ``fills in the hole'' left by removing the blow-up subset from \(V(\langle f,g \rangle)\). Thus, we have the limit points of the cell \(C\) as it approaches the blow-up subset \(B\).
In order to find the refinement points above \(\mathbf{p}\), we compute a generating set (Groebner basis) \(\{ f_1,\ldots,f_k \}\) for \(S\) and solve the system of equations
\[
f_1 = 0, \ldots, f_k = 0, g = 0, h = 0.
\]

Note that this procedure only works if the blow-up points have dimension zero. Otherwise, the endpoints of 1-dimensional cells in the frontier of \(C\) will not be sufficient to satisfy the frontier condition.

Let \(\cal D\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n, n \le 3\). If \(n \le 2\), \(\cal D\) is already strong -- well-bordered, boundary smooth and satisfies the frontier condition. In particular, by Lemma \ref{lem:only-bad-zero-cells}, the frontier condition is already satisfied since there are no bad cells in the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) \citep[Lemma 4.3]{lazard10}.
Also by Lemma \ref{lem:only-bad-zero-cells}, any bad cells in the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) are \(0\)-dimensional \citep[Lemma 4.3]{lazard10}.
Therefore, the frontier condition is satisfied everywhere except in the neighbourhoods above bad cells in the induced decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). The following algorithm is a special method for lifting above a bad cell.

\section{Generalisation of Lazard}\label{sec:lazard-n}}

Every \(2\)-dimensional cylindrical cell in a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is the graph of a continuous definable map \(\mathbf{f} = (f_1,\ldots,f_{n-2}) : X \to \mathbb{R}^{n-2}\) where \(X \subset {\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}, 1 \le i < j \le n\) in a cylindrical
\((1,1)\)-cell by Proposition \ref{prp:delete-zero-index} (\citet{bgv13}, Lemma 3.3). According to the remark following
Definition \ref{def:blow-up-point}, each component \(f_j : X \to {\operatorname{span} \{x_j\}}\) of \(\mathbf{f}\) is a continuous definable map at every point in \({\operatorname{cl} \left( X \right)}\) except for a finite set of isolated points in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( X \right)} = {\operatorname{cl} \left( X \right)} \setminus X\).
Therefore, it might be natural to ask whether the result from \citet{lazard10} for lifting with bad points can be generalised to cylindrical decompositions of \(\mathbb{R}^n, n > 3\) compatible with semialgebraic sets of dimension at most \(2\).
Our goal is to construct a CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), monotone with respect to each set \(V_1, \ldots, V_k\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) for all \(1 \le i \le k\), such that \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}\), for each cell \(C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) is a union of some cells of \(\mathcal{D}\).
Note that this method is not claimed to work for all cells of \(\mathcal{D}\), in particular, those of dimension \(> 2\).

In Section \ref{sec:lazard-3}, we applied Lazard's method for lifting with bad cells to CADs of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) output by the algorithm described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm}. Lazard's algorithm required the input CAD to have two properties. First, each cell must be boundary smooth. Since each cell \(C \subset V = V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k\) is constructed to be monotone, it is already topologically regular by Proposition \ref{prp:monotone-topologically-regular} (\citet{bgv13}, Theorem 1), and is therefore already boundary smooth.
The second requirement is that every cell must be well-bordered. While Corollary \ref{cor:lazard-5-4} (\citet{lazard10}, Corollary 5.4) asserts that any sign-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) is well-bordered, this property cannot be extended to CADs of arbitrary dimension. Indeed, \citet{lazard10}, Example 2.11 describes a \(3\)-dimensional cylindrical cell in \(\mathbb{R}^4\) which cannot be well-bordered since its frontier consists of a single half-line. This condition is necessary to get the configuration of cells described in Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-13} (\citet{lazard10}, Lemma 5.13), which is required to apply the algorithm for lifting with bad points. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this method could be generalised to cells of dimension \(> 2\).

\begin{definition}
\protect\hypertarget{def:strong-about-c}{}\label{def:strong-about-c}Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(C\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\). \(\mathcal{D}\) will be called strong about \(C\) if \(C\) is well-bordered, boundary coherent and every cell contained in \({\operatorname{cl} \left( ( \right)}C)\) is boundary smooth.
\end{definition}

We first extend Corollary \ref{cor:lazard-5-4} (\citet{lazard10}, Corollary 5.4) to cells of dimension \(\le 2\) in a sign-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
This can be done by extending \citet{lazard10}, Theorem 5.3.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:lazard-5-3}{}\label{thm:lazard-5-3}\citep[Theorem 5.3]{lazard10}

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) such that the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is strong. Then every cell \(C\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) is well-bordered.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If \(\dim(C) < 2\), then \(C\) is well-bordered by \citet{lazard10}, Lemma 5.1.

If \(\dim(C) = 2\) and \(C\) is a \((1,1,0)\)-cell, then its boundary consists of some section cells which project onto one-dimensional cells in \(\mathcal{D}\) and which are contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) and points or intervals projecting on some \(0\)-cells in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) by Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-2} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.2).
We need to prove that these points belong to the boundary of some of the \(1\)-cells contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\).
Let \(\mathbf{c}\) be a \(0\)-cell of \(\mathcal{D'}\) contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) such that \(\mathbf{c}\) is the projection of exactly one point, \(\mathbf{p}\), in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\).
Since \(C'\) is well-bordered (as \(\mathcal{D'}\) is strong), there is a \(1\)-dimensional cell \(C'_1 \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) such that \(\mathbf{c}\) is an endpoint.
If \(C'_1\) is the projection of a \(1\)-dimensional cell contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\), we are done -- the boundary of this one-dimensional cell consists of some isolated points including \(\mathbf{p}\).
\(C'_1\) is not the projection of a section cell, then the limits of the sequences of points in \(C\), whose projections tend to \(C'_1\), tend to \(-\infty\) or \(\infty\). Therefore \(\mathbf{p}\) is either \(-\infty\) or \(\infty\), being an endpoint of the interval \(I\) associated to \(C\) by Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-2} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.2). This contradicts the assumption that \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}}^{-1}(\mathbf{c}) \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) contains only \(\mathbf{p}\).

If \(\dim(C) = 2\) and it is a sector (\((i_1,i_2,1)\)-cell), then \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) consists of the two \((i_1,i_2,0)\)-cells \(C_B\) and \(C_T\) which project on \(C'\) the side-wall \(W = {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} \setminus (C_B \cup C_T)\) which consists of points or intervals projecting on the endpoints of \(C'\).
If \(W\) contains an isolated point above an endpoint \(\mathbf{c}\) of \(C'\). Then Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-2} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.2) asserts that it belongs to the boundary of a section bounding \(C\) from below or above (i.e., \(C_B\) or \(C_T\)), and we are done.

Finally, suppose that \(C\) is a \((1,1,1)\)-cell.
By the proof of \citet{lazard10}, Theorem 4.4, we only need to consider points in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) which projects on a bad cell, say \(\mathbf{b}\), of \(\mathcal{D'}\).
By \citet{lazard10}, Lemma 4.3 \(\dim(\mathbf{b}) = 0\).
\(C_B\) and \(C_T\) are \((1,1,0)\)-cells, therefore we only need to consider the blow-up subsets \(B := ({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} \setminus ({\operatorname{cl} \left( C_B \right)} \cup {\operatorname{cl} \left( C_T \right)})) \cap (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbb{R})\). By Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-2} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.2) \(B\) is an open interval.
As \(C'\) is well-bordered, there is a \(1\)-dimensional cell \(C'_1 \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) such that \(\mathbf{b}\) is an endpoint.
The set of points of \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) which project onto \(C'_1\) are bounded from below and above by points of \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_B \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_T \right)}\), thus they are \(1\)-dimensional section cells. The boundaries of these section cells are included in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_B \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C_T \right)}\).
Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-2} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.2) implies that these sections which project onto \(C'_1\) define a (finite and non empty) \(2\)-dimensional sector cell which projects onto \(C'_1\) whose boundary
contains \(B\).

As all cases have been considered, this completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\protect\hypertarget{prp:ext-lazard-5-3}{}\label{prp:ext-lazard-5-3}(Corollary to \citet{lazard10}, Theorem 5.3)

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(C\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) of dimension \(\le 2\) such that the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is strong about \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\). Then \(C\) is well-bordered.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If \(\dim(C) \le 2\), then it is well-bordered by \citet{lazard10}, Lemma 5.1.
If \(\dim(C) = 2\) and \(C\) is a sector cell, the same argument as in Theorem \ref{thm:lazard-5-3} (\citet{lazard10}, Theorem 5.3) can be applied.

Otherwise, \(\dim(C) = 2\) and \(C\) is a sector cell. \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\) is a well-bordered, boundary smooth and boundary coherent \(2\)-dimensional cell in \(\mathcal{D'}\). The same argument as in Theorem \ref{thm:lazard-5-3} (\citet{lazard10}, Theorem 5.3) can be applied to the cells in \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \right)} \times \mathbb{R}\), which have dimension \(\le 2\) or are sector cells of dimension \(3\).
\end{proof}

By Lemma \ref{lem:no-blow-up}, if no cells which intersect \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) project on a bad cell and the induced decomposition is strong, \(C\) is well-bordered, boundary smooth and satisfies the frontier condition. Since the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:no-blow-up} only considers cells contained in \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}) \times \mathbb{R}\) this property is also true for the weaker property that the induced decomposition is strong about \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\).
Thus, we need to look at what happens in the neighbourhood of bad cells (blow-up points) only.
If there is a blow-up point, then we claim that the following situation, similar to that described in Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-13} (\citet{lazard10}, Lemma 5.13), occurs.

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:ext-lazard-5-13}{}\label{lem:ext-lazard-5-13}

(Extension of Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-13} \citep[Proposition 5.13]{lazard10})

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a sign-invarient decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(C\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) of dimension at most two, such that the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) is strong about \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}}(C)\). Let \(D\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that \(B := D \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left(  C  \right)} \neq \emptyset\) and \(B \neq D\). Then either

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(C\) is a \(1\)-dimensional section cell whose endpoint, \(B\), projects on a bad cell, or
\item
  there exists a cell \(E\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that \(\dim(E) < \dim(C)\) and \(\emptyset \neq D \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left(  E  \right)} \neq D\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

By the proof of \citep[Theorem 4.4]{lazard10}, \(D\) will always be a \((0,\ldots,0,1)\)-cell in the cylinder above a bad cell \(D'\).

We consider each case by cell index.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\)-cell, where \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} i_j = 1\): observe that \(C\) (if bounded) is delineated by some \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cells (one-dimensional curve intervals). Take \(B\) to be the one-dimensional interval delineated by the endpoints of these curves. Since \(B \neq C\), at least one of these endpoints is not a \((0,\ldots,0,0)\)-cell of \(\cal D\). Case 2 applies, taking as \(E\) the delineating \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cell.
\item
  \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cells, where \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} i_j = 1\): consider the previous case, letting \(C = E\).
\item
  \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cell, where \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} i_j = 2\):
  \(C\) is necessarily the root of a polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) which vanishes identically on \(D'\), a \((0,\ldots,0)\) cell in the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\).
  Let \(V_r\) be a small neighbourhood (with radius \(r > 0\)) centred around \(D'\) and consider \(V_r'\), the cylinder above the boundary of \(V_r\). Since \(C\) is a monotone cell, the maximum and minimum values of \(x_n\) in this intersection are obtained on the boundary of \(C\), for sufficiently small \(r\). The limits, as \(r\) tends to \(0\), of this maximum and minimum clearly belong to the boundary of \(B\), if these limits do not tend to infinity. Note that both the maximum and minimum cannot be infinite, since this would imply that either \(B\) is empty, or coincides with \(D\). Therefore, the non-infinite limits are the endpoints of some \(1\)-dimensional cell belonging to the boundary of \(C\). Case 2 applies, taking \(E\) to be this \(1\)-dimensional cell.
\item
  \((0,\ldots,0,1)\)- or \((0,\ldots,0,0)\)-cells: do not satisfy the hypothesis, there is nothing to do.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Let \(C\) be a \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cell as described in Lemma \ref{lem:ext-lazard-5-13} such that \(i_1=i_k = 1\) for some \(1 \le k \le n\) and all other elements of the index are equal to zero.
The cell \(D\), which projects on a bad-cell is necessarily a \((0,\ldots,0,1)\)-cell and the cell \(E\), which has dimension one, is contained in \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}\). Hence, \(E\) must have index either \((i_1,0\ldots,0)\) or \((0,\ldots,0,i_k,0,\ldots,0)\).
By Proposition \ref{prp:delete-zero-index} (\citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.3), the images of \(C\), \(D\) and \(E\) under the projection map \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{i_1,i_k,i_n\}}}}\) are cylindrical cells and satisfy Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-13} (\citet{lazard10}, Lemma 5.13).
\end{remark}

This implies that we should be able to use a similar technique to that described in Proposition \ref{prp:lazard-5-14} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.14) to lift above bad cells and satisfy the frontier condition on two-dimensional section cells in decompositions of arbitrary dimension.

\begin{conjecture}
\protect\hypertarget{cnj:ext-lazard-5-14}{}\label{cnj:ext-lazard-5-14}(Extension of \citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.14)

Let \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\) be an irreducible polynomial of the kind
\[f = h_dx_n^d + \ldots + h_1x_n + h_0\]
with each \(h_i \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]\), and
\[\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1})\]
be a common root of \(h_d,\ldots,h_1,h_0\).
Let \(g_1,\ldots,g_{n-2}\in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]\) be irreducible, pairwise relatively prime polynomials having \(\mathbf{p}\) as a root.
Then the limits of the common roots of \(f\) and \(g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}\) for \(\{i_1,\ldots,i_{n-2}\} = \{1,\ldots,n-1\} \setminus \ell, 1 \le \ell \le n-1\) as \((x_1, \ldots,x_{n-1}) \to \mathbf{p}, (x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}) \ne \mathbf{p}\) may be computed as the solutions of a system of polynomial equations having dimension zero.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{proof}
Since \(f\) is irreducible, it has at least \(2\) coefficients, \(h_1,h_2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]\), whose GCD is a constant.
Therefore, any ideal generated by these coefficients has codimension at least two and, since polynomials \(g_1,\ldots,g_{n-1}\) are irreducible and pairwise relatively prime, the ideal generated by the coefficients of \(f\) and the polynomials, \(g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}\) has dimension zero.
Any ideal containing these polynomials also contains another element, \(g_\ell\), which is not a multiple of any of the \(g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}\)'s.

The saturation by \(g_\ell\) of the ideal \(\langle f, g_{i_1}, \ldots, g_{i_{n-2}} \rangle\) is defined as the ideal
\[
S := \langle f, g_{i_1}, \ldots, g_{i_{n-2}}, 1 - z g_\ell \rangle \cap \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\ldots,x_n].
\]
The irreducible components of the zero set of \(S\) are those of the zero set of \(\langle f,g_{i_1},\ldots,i_{n-2} \rangle\) at which \(g_\ell\) is not identically zero. It follows that the vertical line \(\{ x_1 = p_1, \ldots, x_{n-1} = p_{n-1} \}\) which is part of the zero set of \(f\),
\(g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}\) and \(g_\ell\), is not contained in the zero set of \(S\).
Meanwhile, the zero set of \(S\) contains the limit points we are interested in finding.

Therefore, the ideal generated by \(S\), the coefficients \(h_0,\ldots,h_d\) of \(f\) and the polynomials \(g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}\) is zero-dimensional and the limits of \(\{ f = 0, g_{i_1} = 0, \ldots, g_{i_{n-n}} = 0 \}\) as \((x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) \to \mathbf{p}\) can be computed as the solutions of \(S\).
\end{proof}

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be an \(\mathbf{F}\) invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) as constructed by the algorithm in Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm}.
Recall that, in the previous results, we require the decomposition induced on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\) to be strong about the projections of some cells of \(\mathcal{D}\). Therefore, we need to proceed by induction on decompositions induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k, k \ge 1\) to be able to apply Lemma \ref{lem:ext-lazard-5-13} and Conjecture \ref{cnj:ext-lazard-5-14}.

For \(k\le 2\), we have a \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(\mathbf{F})\)-invariant CAD which already satisfies the frontier condition by \citet{lazard10}, Corollary 4.7.
For \(k=3\), recall that every cell is well-bordered by Corollary \ref{cor:lazard-5-4} (\citet{lazard10}, Corollary 5.4). We already described how to construct a \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}}(\mathbf{F})\)-invariant CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying the frontier condition using \citet{lazard10}, Algorithm 5.15.

For \(k>3\) let \(\mathcal{D'}\) be the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\) and let \(C\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D'}\) such that \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}^{-1}(C) \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\).
By the induction hypothesis, the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D'}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\) is strong about \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(C)\).
\(C\) is topologically regular since the projection of a monotone cell is monotone and \(C\) is well-bordered by Proposition \ref{prp:ext-lazard-5-3} since \(\dim(C) \le 2\).
If \(\dim(C) < 2\), \(C\) already satisfies the frontier condition since it is well-bordered.
If \(\dim(C') = 2\), then \(C\) is an \((i_1,\ldots,i_k)\)-cell such that \(i_{\ell_1} = i_{\ell_2} = 1\) and all other elements of the index are equal to zero.

First suppose that \(\ell_1 = 1\). If \(\ell_2 < k\) then \(C\) is a section cell.
Let \(C' = {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(C)\). \(C'\) satisfies the frontier condition by the induction hypothesis and \(C\) is the graph of a continuous definable function \(\varphi : C' \to \mathbb{R}\).
\({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}\) is the graph of \(\varphi\) for all but, possibly, a finite number of isolated blow-up points in \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \right)}\) (see Remark after Definition \ref{def:blow-up-point}).
Let \(\mathcal{A}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{A}_k\) be the set of projection polynomials defining \(\mathcal{D'}\). By the construction of CAD, these polynomials are irreducible. Let
\[
C \subset \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^k \mid g_{j_1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{j_{n-2}}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}
\]
where each \(g_i \in \mathcal{A}_i\) for \(j \in \{i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1}\} \setminus \{i_{\ell_1}, i_{\ell_2} \}\) and \(f \in \mathcal{A}_k\).
Suppose that there is a \((0,\ldots,0,1)\)-cell \(D\) such that \(D \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) and \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in D\). I.e., \(\mathbf{b} := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(D)\) \(D\) is a bad cell and is a common root of \(g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{n-2}}\) and some \(g_{\ell_1} \in \mathcal{A}_{\ell_1}, g_{\ell_2} \in \mathcal{A}_{\ell_2}\).
Apply a method similar to that described in \citet{lazard10}, Algorithm 5.15 to \(C\) and \(D\). Using Conjecture \ref{cnj:ext-lazard-5-14}, compute the saturations by \(g_{\ell_1}\) and \(g_{\ell_2}\), respectively:
\begin{equation}
I_1 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-3}}, g_{\ell_2}, 1 - z g_{\ell_1} \rangle \cap \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k]
\label{eq:lazard-n-1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
I_2 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-3}}, g_{\ell_1}, 1 - z g_{\ell_2} \rangle \cap \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k],
\label{eq:lazard-n-2}
\end{equation}
where \(z\) is a new variable.
Let \(S_1, S_2\) be Groebner bases for \(I_1,I_2\) respectively. The union of zero-dimensional solutions to \(S_1,S_2\) forms the set of refinement points \(\mathcal{R}_\mathbf{b}\) whiche contains the endpoints of \(D \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\), By considering each bad cell in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( ( \right)}{\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(C))\), \(\mathcal{D}'\) can be refined such that \(C\) satisfies the frontier condition.

On the other hand, if \(\ell_2 = k\), \(C\) is a sector cell. In this case, \(C\) already satisfies the frontier condition since its top and bottom, which are one-dimensional section cells, already satisfy the frontier condition and its side-wall consists of at most two connected components, points or closed intervals, whose endpoints are endpoints of the top and bottom of \(C\).

Finaly, if \(\ell_1 > 1\) then \(C\) is a \((0,\ldots,0,i_{\ell_1},\ldots,i_k)\)-cell. Apply the method above to the \((i_{\ell_1 + 1},\ldots,i_k)\)-cell in the sub-cad above \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{i_\ell - 1}}}(C)\).

Compute a refinement of \(\mathcal{D}\) so that it is compatible with the sets of refinement points \(\mathcal{R}_\mathbf{b}\). These are refinements of the kind described in \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.11, and preserve the cylindrical structure and monotone cells in \(\mathcal{D}\).
\(\mathcal{D'}\) has been refined such that it satisfies the frontier condition, hence it is strong about each cell \(C\) such that \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}^{-1}(C) \subset V_1\cup \ldots, \cup V_k\). This completes the inductive step.

\begin{algorithm}Extension of Lazard's Lifting With Bad Points, for $2$-dimensional cells in $\R^n$

\citep[Extension of][Algorithm 5.15]{lazard10}

\textbf{Input:}
\[({\cal D}, {\cal A})\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\cal D\): a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), each cell having constant sign on \(\mathcal{A}\), A collection of cells \(\mathcal{C} := \{ C_1,\ldots,C_m \}\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) are marked as being projections of \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\).
\item
  \({\cal A} = {\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_k\) is the family of projection polynomials for \(\mathcal{D}\), each \({\cal A}_k \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k]\).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output:}

\[

\]

A set of refinement points, as described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Let \(\cal D'\) be the decomposition induced by \(\cal D\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\).
\item
  For each \((i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1},0)\)-cell \(E \in \cal{C}\), let \(i_{\ell_1} = i_{\ell_2} = 1\), while all other elements in the index are equal to zero.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Let \(\mathbf{c} := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{j_{\ell_1} - 1}}}(E)\) and compute the set of polynomials for the sub-cad of \(\mathcal{D}\) above \(\mathbf{c}\).

    I.e., Let \(C := {\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{i_\ell,\ldots,i_k\}}}}(E)\) be an \((i_{\ell_1},\ldots,i_{k-1},0)\)-cell in the sub-cad of \(\mathcal{D}\) above \(\mathbf{c}\). Compute the substitution of polynomials
    \[
    \mathcal{A'}_{j} := \{ {\mathrm{sub}}_{\mathbf{c}} (f) \in \mathbb{Z}[x_{\ell_1},\ldots,x_j] \mid f \in \mathcal{A}_{i_{\ell_1} - 1 + j} \}
    \]
    for \(i_{\ell_1} \le j \le k\).
  \item
    Find, by examining signs of projection polynomials associated to \(C\), polynomials
    \[
    (g_{j_1},\ldots,g_{k-3}, f), g_j \in \mathcal{A'}_j, j \in \{\ell_1 + 1,\ldots,k-1\} \setminus \{ \ell_2 \}, f \in \mathcal{A'}_k
    \]
    such that \(C \subset \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-\ell_1 + 1} \mid (g_{j_1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0,\ldots,g_{k-3}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}\).
  \item
    Determine whether any point on the frontier of \(C\) projects on a bad cell. I.e., check if there is a \((0,\ldots,0,1)\)-cell \(D\), by examining signs of projection polynomials, such that \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 0\) for all \(\mathbf{x} \in D\).

    I.e., all of \(g_{j_1},\ldots,g_{j_{k-3}},f\) should be equal to zero on \(D\).
  \item
    For each \(D\) projecting on a bad cell, let \(\mathbf{b} := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(D)\).

    Since \(\mathbf{b}\) is a \((0,\ldots,0)\)-cell, polynomials \(g_{j_1},\ldots,g_{j_{k-3}}\) are equal to zero on \(\mathbf{b}\) and there are two more polynomials \(g_{\ell_1} \in \mathcal{A'}_{\ell_1}, g_{\ell_2} \in \mathcal{A'}_{\ell_2}\) which are equal to zero on \(\mathbf{b}\).

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Compute saturations \[
      I_1 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-3}}, g_{\ell_2}, 1 - z g_{\ell_1} \rangle \cap \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k]
      \]
      and
      \[
      I_2 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-3}}, g_{\ell_1}, 1 - z g_{\ell_2} \rangle \cap \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k],
      \]
      where \(z\) is a new variable.
    \item
      Compute generator systems \(S_1, S_2\) for \(I_1,I_2\) respectively.

      This may be done by computing a Groebner basis eliminating \(z\).
    \item
      Finally, to obtain refinement polynomials for \(D\), substitute
      \[
      L := \{ {\mathrm{sub}}_{\mathbf{b}}(f) \in \mathbb{Q}[x_k] \mid f \in S_1 \cup S_2 \}.
      \]
    \item
      Refinement points are the roots
      \[
      (c_1,\ldots,c_t)
      \]
      of polynomials in \(L\).
    \item
      Let
      \[
      {\cal R} := {\cal R} \cup \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} = (c_1,\ldots,c_t) \}.
      \]
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  return \(\cal R\).
\end{itemize}

\end{algorithm}

Apply this procedure to each decomposition, for \(3 \le k \le n\) induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\) and compute the refinement of sections above bad cells using the same method described in Section \ref{sec:compute-refinement} to obtain a refinement \(\mathcal{E}\) of \(\mathcal{D}\). Note that, since refinement points are algebraic numbers splitting \((1)\)-cells in induced decompositions, \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.11 asserts that the cylindrical structure and monotone cells are preserved in \(\mathcal{E}\).

\hypertarget{correctness-and-complexity-2}{%
\subsection{Correctness and Complexity}\label{correctness-and-complexity-2}}

Since zero- and one-dimensional cells already satisfy the frontier condition, it suffices to consider cells of dimension two.
Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^k\) and \(C\) be a two-dimensional section cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\) is strong about \(C\). Proposition \ref{prp:ext-lazard-5-3} asserts that \(C\) is well-bordered, so its frontier consists of the closure of some one-dimensional cells of \(\mathcal{D}\). The frontier condition fails in the region of sector cells of \(\mathcal{D}\) above \(0\)-dimensional bad cells in the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\).
The procedure described above explains how to obtain some new polynomials which allow these one-dimensional sectors to be refined such that they are compatible with the frontier of \(C\). By performing this refinement, \(C\) is made to satisfy the forntier condition.

If \(C\) is a \(2\)-dimensional sector cell, then its top and bottom are \(1\)-dimensional sector cells of \(\mathcal{D}\) and the side-wall of \(C\) is contained in cylinders \(\mathbf{c} \times \mathbb{R}\), where \(\mathbf{c}\) is a zero-dimensional cell which is an endpoint of \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k-1}}}(C)\). It follows that \(C\) satisfies the frontier condition sits its top and bottom, which are one-dimensional cells, satisfy the frontier condition.

\hypertarget{complexity-analysis}{%
\subsection{Complexity analysis}\label{complexity-analysis}}

We will see, in Section \ref{sec:novel-frontier}, that there is an algorithm for obtaining the frontier condition on a CAD compatible with a semialgebraic set of arbitrary dimension. This algorithm has complexity \((sd)^{O(1)^{n2^n}}\) -- triply exponential in the number of variables. However, in the particular case of semialgebraic sets having dimension at most two, the complexity may be lower. This is now discussed.

Let us first discuss complexity in relation to the procedure described by \citet{bgv15} in Theorem 3.20. Given the family \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is computed for each \(2\)-dimensional cell \(C \subset V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k\) According to Lemma \ref{lem:frontier}, there is an algorithm, which uses \citet{bpr2006} Algorithm 14.21 as its main subroutine, for computing \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\), having complexity \[
(sd)^{O(n^2)},
\]
where \(C\) is defined by \(s\) different polynomials of maximum degree \(d\).
\(C\) has constant sign on all polynomials defining the CAD, so, using the bounds discussed in Sections \ref{sec:quasi-complexity} and \ref{sec:monotone-complexity}, the complexity upper bound for computing \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is
\[
\left(\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\cdot\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\right)^{O(n^2)},
\]
which is asymptotically the same as
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}..
\]
Note that, in some cases, only some of the \(\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\) polynomials are required to define the cell \(C\).
This is, according to Lemma \ref{lem:frontier}, an upper bound on the number of polynomials and their degrees in the QFF defining \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\).
The procedure requires us to partition \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) into points and monotone curve intervals.
In order to do this, a similar process as that used to obtain monotone cells (see Section \ref{sec:monotone-cells}) can be used. This will be repeated for each of the \(2\)-dimensional cells contained in \(V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k\). As such, the overall complexity will be the same as that presented in Section \ref{sec:monotone-complexity}. I.e.,
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]

Now let us consider the extension of \citet{lazard10}, discussed in Section \ref{sec:lazard-n}.
For each \(1\)-dimensional sector cell which projects on a \(0\)-dimensional bad cell, the saturation of ideals, defined in Equations \eqref{eq:lazard-n-1} and \eqref{eq:lazard-n-2} are computed. There will be at most \(n\) polynomials, in \(n+1\) variables, appearing in these ideals. The saturation of these ideals is computed by finding a Groebner basis for them.
According to \citet{lakshman1991}, if the ideal \(I = \langle f_1,\ldots,f_k\rangle\) where \(f_1,\ldots,f_k\) are polynomials in \(n\) variables, then a Groebner basis for \(I\) can be computed in time singly exponential in \(n\).
However, in our case, only the saturation of the ideal over the real numbers is zero-dimensional, rather than the
original ideal over complex numbers before eliminating the new variable \(z\). Therefore, the complexity of computing a
Groebner basis is doubly exponential in the number of variables -- \(2^{2^n}\) \citep{mayr1997}. In the worst case, we may be considering a \((1,1,0,\ldots,0)\)-cell, part of whose frontier projects on a bad \((0,0)\)-cell in the induced decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). It follows that at most \(n-2\) Groebner basis computations will be required. Thus, the total complexity for lifting above a bad cell is at most
\[
n \cdot 2^{2^n} = 2^{n 2^n}.
\]
The bound on the number of bad cells is unknown, but it is obviously bounded from above by the total number of cells in the induced decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). I.e., \((s(d+1))^{2^{O(n-1)}}\).
It follows that the complexity of the algorithm arising from the generalisation of Lazard is
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n-1}} \cdot 2^{n 2^n},
\]
which is bounded from above by
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]

Both approaches -- \citet{bgv15} and the generalisation of \citet{lazard10} -- have the same complexity upper bound.

To summarise, each of the three stages -- quasi-affine, monotone and frontier condition -- of the algorithm for computing a CAD which is monotone with respect to all \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\) for all \(1 \le i \le k\), and satisfying the frontier condition each has complexity \((s(d+1))^{2^{O(n)}}\).
Thus, the overall complexity of this algorithm is
\[
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]
By Proposition \ref{prp:collins}, this is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials and their degrees defining this CAD.

Recall that the complexity of computing a ``classical'' CAD (from Proposition \ref{prp:collins}) is \[
(sd)^{O(1)^n}.
\]
Therefore, the monotone CAD algorithm has, as expected, a slightly higher complexity than that of the classical algorithm.
However, the complexity is not significantly worse, still being doubly exponential in the number of variables.
This discussion completes the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:bgv-algorithm}.

\hypertarget{implementation-on-top-of-qepcad}{%
\section{Implementation on top of QEPCAD}\label{implementation-on-top-of-qepcad}}

There are several well-known implementations of CAD. For example, Maple's \texttt{CylindricalAlgebraicDecompose}, which uses regular chains instead of the classical projection and lifting algorithm of \citet{collins1975}, is reported to work very efficiently \citep{chen2014}. Another efficient implementation of CAD is available in Mathematica. However, \texttt{QEPCAD-B}, a quantifier elimination and cylindrical algebraic decomposition program written in C++ and built on top of the polynomial library SACLIB, was chosen as the starting point for the monotone CAD algorithm.

\texttt{QEPCAD} stands for Quantifier Elimination by Partial Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition. It takes as input a first-order Boolean formula \(F\), containing \(k\) free variables and \(n-k\) variables bound by quantifiers, along with a variable ordering \(x_1 < \cdots < x_n\). It then constructs a CAD compatible with the set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^k\) defined by \(F\) and returns a quantifier-free Boolean formula defining \(S\). As well as the output formula, the user is able to examine the polynomials generated in the projection phase and view information about each cell of the CAD, including their dimension, signs of projection factors, multiplicities of roots of polynomials and the sample point associated with the cell. \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} is an extended version of \texttt{QEPCAD} developed by \citet{brownQepcad}.
As well as \(\forall\) and \(\exists\), \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} introduces some special quantifiers which allow the user to specify ``exists exactly \(k\)'', ``exists infinitely many'' and ``for all but finitely many'', allowing the problem to be solved in a more efficient way. \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} is also able to plot and determine cell adjacencies for decompositions of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). An extended language for output formulas, which uses ``\(i\)-th root of polynomial \(f\)'', somewhat similar to the output given by Maple's \texttt{CylindricalAlgebraicDecompose}, is also included.

\texttt{QEPCAD\ B} and \texttt{SACLIB} are open-source, meaning it is easy to extend their functionality. The computer algebra library
\texttt{Singular} is also integrated, which gives the developer access to more efficient algorithms, e.g., for polynomial factorisation. Integration with \texttt{Singular} also gives the developer access to additional computer algebra tools, such as Groebner bases, which are leveraged for the first time in the implementation of Lazard Lifting algorithm.
\texttt{QEPCAD\ B} by default provides the output as a
quantifier-free (Tarski) formula, which is the most convenient representation for our purposes. As shown by \citet{collins1975}, it is not always possible to obtain such formulas using only the polynomials produced in the projection phase.
For this reason, Maple's \texttt{CylindricalAlgebraicDecompose} is only able to produce formulas in the extended language. \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} implements an algorithm to add additional defining polynomials \citep{brown99}. A small modification to this algorithm allows every cell in the CAD to be defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula (see Section \ref{sec:cell-formula}).
This was the main realon for choosing \texttt{QEPCAD\ B}, along with the fact that \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} is open-source which allows the algorithm to easily be modified.

\hypertarget{sec:qepcad}{%
\subsection{Description of QEPCAD B}\label{sec:qepcad}}

The \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} algorithm proceeds in five stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Input}

  The user is prompted to enter the following information:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Informal problem description}, for the user's benefit
  \item
    \emph{Variable list} \((v_1,\ldots,v_n)\) where \(v_i, 1 \le i \le n\) are variable names. Note that this list specifies the variable ordering \(v_1 < \cdots < v_n\).
  \item
    \emph{Number of free variables} \(0 \le k \le n\) appearing in the first-order formula (free variables are those not bound by quantifiers)
  \item
    \emph{Prenex formula} a first order Boolean formula \((Q_1 v_1), \ldots, (Q_k v_k) F\), where \(F\) is a quantifier-free Boolean formula defined by induction such that

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      atoms are polynomial equations, inequations, strict or non-strict inequalities, with polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[v_1,\ldots,v_n]\),
    \item
      Suppose that quantifier-free Boolean formulas \(F_1, F_2,\ldots,F_k\) are defined, then
      \[
      \neg F_1,\> F_1 \Rightarrow F_2,\> F_1 \Leftarrow F_2,\> F_1 \Leftrightarrow F_2,\> F_1 \land \ldots \land F_k,\> F_1 \lor \ldots \lor F_k
      \]
      are quantifier-free Boolean formulas.
    \item
      \((Q_i,v_i), 1 \le i \le k\) where
      \[
      Q_i \in \{ \exists, \exists_k, \exists_\infty, \forall, \forall_\neg \}
      \]
      quantify the first \(k\) variables in the list \((v_1,\ldots,v_n)\). Quantifiers \(\forall, \exists\) are defined as expected. New quantifiers are defined as follows
    \item
      \(\exists_k v_i\): there are exactly \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) values of \(v_i\) satisfying \(F\).
    \item
      \(\exists_\infty v_i\): there are infinitely many values of \(v_i\) satisfying \(F\),
    \item
      \(\forall_\neg\): all but a finite number of values of \(v_i\) satisfy \(F\).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Normalisation}

  Let \((Q_1,v_1),\ldots,(Q_k,v_k) F\) be the input formula. The normalisation phase uses logical equivalences and polynomial factorisation to transform \(F\) into a ``normalised'' formula \(G\), defined by induction as follows:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    atoms are of the form \(f \ast 0\) where \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[v_1,\ldots,v_n]\) is a primitive, irreducible polynomial and \(\ast \in \{=, \ne, <, \le, >, \ge \}\).
  \item
    Suppose that normalised formulas \(G_1,\ldots,G_k\) are already defined, then
    \[
     G_1 \land \cdots \land G_k \text{ and } G_1 \lor \cdots \lor G_k
     \]
    are normalised formulas.
  \item
    The family
    \[
     \mathcal{A} = (\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots,\mathcal{A}_n)
     \] of input polynomials is constructed, where each \(\mathcal{A}_k \subset \mathbb{Z}[v_1,\ldots,v_k]\) contains the polynomials appearing in \(G\) with nonzero degree in \(v_k\) but zero degree in all variables \(v_{k+1},\ldots,v_n\).
    \(\mathcal{A}_k\) is called the set of level-\(k\) input polynomials.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Projection}

  The projection phase of CAD is then performed. The user is able to specify the projection operator to be used at each level. Implemented operators are

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Collins' projection,
  \item
    McCallum's projection,
  \item
    Hong's projection,
  \item
    Lazard's projection,
  \item
    ``Partial'' reduced McCallum projection
    (only adds the leading coefficient if it can be proved that lifting is never performed over a cell on which the polynomial vanishes identically),
  \item
    McCallum's projection excluding leading coefficients.
  \end{itemize}

  By default, the \emph{partial reduced McCallum} projection operator is used. It is noted in the documentation that McCallum's projection operator is preferred, as it produces fewer projection polynomials, but can sometimes fail during the lifting phase. In this case, an error is printed and the user is advised to use Hong's projection operator, which is guaranteed to succeed, but produces more polynomials.

  Families \(\mathcal{P} := (\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_n)\) and \(\mathcal{F} := (\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_n)\) are constructed, where \(\mathcal{P}_k\) is the set of level-\(k\) projection polynomials, and \(\mathcal{F}_k\), containing factorised elements of \(\mathcal{A}_k \cup \mathcal{P}_k\) is the set of level-\(k\) ``projection factors''. Elements of \(\mathcal{F}\) are used to construct the CAD in the next step.
\item
  \textbf{Lifting} (stack construction)

  By default, \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} constructs a CAD which is compatible with the set defined by the input formula,
  Before the lifting phase is started, the user may specify \texttt{full-cad}, which constructs a CAD with constant sign on all projection factors.

  A CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-k}\) (free variable space) is constructed such that the union of true cells is the set defined by the input formula.
  Truth values are either explicitly assigned to cells using the input formula or propagated down to free variable space using the quantifiers appearing in the input formula.
\item
  \textbf{Solution formula construction}

  Given the CAD \(\mathcal{D}\), whose union of true cells coincides with the set defined by the input formula, a quantifier-free Boolean formula defining this set is produced. \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} attempts to use the projection factors in this formula, but sometimes additional polynomials (derivatives of projection factors) must be added in order to define the required set.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{qepcad-cells-and-sample-points}{%
\subsection{QEPCAD Cells and Sample Points}\label{qepcad-cells-and-sample-points}}

Since the main advantage of the monotone CAD algorithm is to produce a CAD with cells having desirable topological properties, we are mostly interested in examining individual CAD cells rather than QEPCAD's output formula.

Consider a simple example of a CAD compatible with the unit circle in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), defined by the quantifier-free Boolean formula
\[
F = \{ x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \}.

A QEPCAD cell \(C\) includes the following information

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Positional index} \((j_1,\ldots,j_{n-k}), j_i \in \mathbb{N}, 1 \le i \le n-k\), indicates the position of this cell in the CAD;
\item
  \textbf{Level} \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), the level of the cell;
\item
  \textbf{Dimension} \(d \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}\), the dimension of the cell;
\item
  \textbf{Number of children}, where a child is a CAD cell \(D\) of level \(k+1\) such that \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(D) = C\);
\item
  \textbf{Truth value} (and how it was determined), \(t \in \{ \rm{TRUE, FALSE, UNDET} \}\), truth values may be determined by trial evaluation, propagation or equational constraints;
\item
  \textbf{Degrees after substitution}, \((d_1,\ldots,d_m) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^m\) such that \(d_i\) is the degree of the \(i\)-th level \(k\) projection factor after substitution;
\item
  \textbf{Multiplicities}, \(((i_1,m_1),\ldots,(i_{\ell},m_{\ell})) \in (\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N})^\ell\), where \(m_j\) is the multiplicity of the root of the \(i_j\)-th substituted level-\(k\) projection factor;
\item
  \textbf{Signs of Projection Factors} (for each level) \((S_1,\ldots,S_k)\), where each \(S_i = (s_1,\ldots,s_{m_k}) \in \{ 1,-1,0 \}^m\) indicates the signs of level-\((k-i+1)\) projection factors
\item
  \textbf{Sample Point} \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{A}^k\).
\end{itemize}

A sample point of a cell \(C\) is an algebraic number \(\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_k) \in C\). This may be represented in one of two forms in QEPCAD.
A primitive sample point \(\mathbf{x}\) is an element of the algebraic extension field \(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) and is represented by the triple
\[
(M, I, \mathbf{c})
\]
where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(M \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\) is a primitive, irreducible polynomial having \(\alpha \in \mathbb{A}\) as a root,
\item
  \(I \subset \mathbb{Q}\) is an isolating interval for \(\alpha\) as a root of \(M\),
\item
  \(\mathbf{c} = (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)^n\).
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{SACLIB} representation for rational and algebraic numbers is used. A rational number \(x = a/b\) is stored as a two-element list \((a,b)\). An element \(x \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) is stored as a two-element list \((q, g) \in \mathbb{Q}\times \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]\), where \(x = q \cdot g(\alpha)\). If \(x \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) is rational, then it is stored as \(x = x \cdot \alpha^0 = x \cdot 1\). Likewise, if the sample point \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Q}^k\), i.e., it only contains rational numbers, the minimal polynomial \(M := x\) and isolating interval \(I = (0,0)\).

For a sample point \(\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1},x_k) \in \mathbb{A}^k\) with coordinates \((x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}) \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) (where at least one of \(x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}\) is irrational) and irrational \(x_k \not \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\), the sample point is stored in extended (non-primitive) form.
This representation splits \(\mathbf{x}\) into \(\mathbf{y} = (x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}) \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) and \(x_k = \beta\) and is stored as the quintuple
\[
(M_\alpha, I_\alpha, \mathbf{c}, M_\beta, J_\beta),
\]
where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(M_\alpha, I_\alpha, \mathbf{c}\) represents \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) as described in the primitive representation
\item
  \(M_\beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)[y]\) is a primitive, irreducible polynomial having \(\beta \in \mathbb{A}\) as a root,
\item
  \(I_\beta \subset \mathbb{Q}\) is an isolating interval for \(\beta\) as a root of \(M_\beta\),
\end{itemize}

Since any finite set of algebraic numbers belongs to a single algebraic extension field \(\mathbb{Q}(\gamma)\), it is always possible to convert a sample point in extended form to primitive form. The QEPCAD function \({\mathrm{CONVERT}}(\mathbf{c}, k)\) converts a non-primitive sample point \(\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{A}^k\) into primitive representation by computing an appropriate \((M_\gamma, I_\gamma)\) so that \(\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{Q}(\gamma)\).

\hypertarget{modifications-to-qepcad}{%
\subsection{Modifications to QEPCAD}\label{modifications-to-qepcad}}

The QEPCAD algorithm has been modified to include construction of quasi-affine cells, refinement of the CAD to produce monotone cells, and refinement of sectors above ``bad cells'' to obtain the frontier condition. A new option, \texttt{mct\ \textless{}y\ /\ n\textgreater{}} has been added, to enable or disable (respectively) the construction of a monotone CAD. The algorithm now proceeds as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Input

  Let \(F\) be a Prenex formula defining a semialgebraic set \(V = V_1 \cup \ldots V_k\) where each \(V_i, 1 \le i \le k\) has dimension \(\le 2\).
\item
  Normalisation

  Normalise the formula \(F\) and construct the set of input polynomials \[
  \mathcal{A} = (\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots,\mathcal{A}_n)
   \]
  as described above.

  If the user enters \texttt{mct\ y}, monotone cells will be constructed. This also enables \texttt{full-cad}, so that the CAD will be sign-invariant on \(\mathcal{A}\).
\item
  \textbf{Projection and Quasi-affine cells}

  If \texttt{mct} is enabled, proceed as described in Section \ref{sec:quasi-affine}. Every one- and two- dimensional cell will be smooth and polynomials which are zero at the critical points of projections to two- and one-dimensional coordinate subspaces will be added to \(\mathcal{A}\). As the projections of polynomials in \(\mathcal{A}\) are computed as part of the algorithm in Section \ref{sec:quasiaffine-algorithm}, this stage also constructs the projection polynomials \(\mathcal{P}\) and projection factor set \(\mathcal{F}\). In order to ensure smooth and quasi-affine cells, new polynomials and their projections are included in the projection factor set \(\mathcal{F}\).

  \sout{Projection} (has already been completed)
\item
  \textbf{Lifting}

  Constructs an \(\mathcal{A}\)-invariant CAD \(\mathcal{D}\). If \texttt{mct} is enabled, each cell \(C \subset V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) will be the graph of a quasi-affine map, due to the polynomials added in the previous step.
\item
  \textbf{Refinement Phase}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Monotone Cells}

    Following the algorithm described in Section \ref{sec:monotone-algorithm}, construct the family of refinement points \[
    {\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} =  (c_1,\ldots,c_t ) \subset \mathbb{A}\mid \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-1} \text{ is a } (0,\ldots,0) \text{-cell in the decomposition induced by } {\cal E} \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^k \}
    \] and add new polynomials (to \(\mathcal{A}\), along with their factors to \(\mathcal{F}\)) which are equal to zero at these refinement points.

    For each refinement point \(c \in \mathbb{A}\) in each family \(\mathcal{R}_\mathbf{b}\), refine the sub-CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-k}\) \(\mathcal{D}\) above the \(0\)-cell \(\mathbf{b}\) by intersecting it with straight lines and half-planes
    \[
    \{ x_{k+1} < c \}, \{ x_{k+1} = c \}, \{ x_{k+1} > c \}.
    \]
    Positional indices and sample points of refined cells are updated.
  \item
    \emph{Frontier Condition}

    Applies the method, similar to that described in \citet{lazard10}, to \(0\)-dimensional ``bad cells'' (see Section \ref{sec:ext-lazard-algorithm}). Groebner bases are constructed using \texttt{Singular}, which is already used for faster polynomial factorisation in \texttt{QEPCAD\ B}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Solution formula construction

  Proceeds unchanged -- prints the solution formula and exits the program.

  The user may pause here to examine the cells in the refined CAD.
\end{enumerate}

In the forthcoming sections, the new code added to \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} is presented and discussed.

\hypertarget{quasi-affine}{%
\subsection{Quasi-affine}\label{quasi-affine}}

The function responsible for constructing a CAD containing quasi-affine cells is \texttt{QUASIAFFINE}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{input}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Word\ r}: number of variables
  \item
    \texttt{Word\ V}: variable list
  \item
    \texttt{Word\ F}: normalised input formula
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Output:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Word*\ A\_}: set of input polynomials
  \item
    \texttt{Word*\ P\_}: set of projection polynomials
  \item
    \texttt{Word*\ J\_}: set of projection factors
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Given the normalised input formula, this function implements a modified version of the projection phase. It returns the polynomials sufficient to construct a CAD such that each one- and two-dimensional cell contained in the set defined by the formula \(F\) is smooth and the graph of a quasi-affine map.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  On line 4, the function \texttt{SmoothOneTwoDim} is called. It constructs a CAD \(\mathcal{E}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^r\), compatible with the set \(V = V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_K \subset \mathbb{R}^r\) defined by the input formula \(F\) using the McCallum projection operator so that every one- and two-dimensional cell of \(\mathcal{E}\) contained in \(V\) is a smooth manifold. In fact, \(\mathcal{E}\) is sign-invariant on the polynomials in \(F\), so \(\mathcal{E}\) is compatible with each \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\). It returns

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{C1s}: set of one-dimensional cells of \(\mathcal{E}\) contained in \(V\),
  \item
    \texttt{C2s}: set of two-dimensional cells of \(\mathcal{E}\) contained in \(V\),
  \item
    \texttt{PIs}: set of input polynomials defining \(\mathcal{E}\) (the polynomials in \(F\)),
  \item
    \texttt{Pps}: set of projection polynomials defining \(\mathcal{E}\),
  \item
    \texttt{Pfs}: set of projection factors (factorised projection polynomials) defining \(\mathcal{E}\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lines 10-23 compute the critical points of projections of \(1\)-dimensional cells in \texttt{C1s} onto one-dimensional coordinate subspaces \({\operatorname{span} \{x_i\}}, 1 \le i \le r\).
\item
  Lines 37-42 compute the critical points of projections of \(2\)-dimensional cells an \texttt{C2s} onto two-dimensional coordinate subspaces \({\operatorname{span} \{x_i,x_j\}}, 1 \le i < j \le n\).
\item
  The \texttt{JACOBI(r,\ f,\ j,\ Hs,\ Is)} function computes a Jacobi determinant \[
  \det \begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \ldots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
  \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \ldots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
  \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \ldots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \] with parameters

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(r \in N\),
  \item
    \(f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_r]\),
  \item
    \(j \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}\)
  \item
    \(\rm{Hs} = (h_1,\ldots,h_k), h_i \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_r], 1 \le i \le k\)
  \item
    \(\rm{Is} = (i_1,\ldots,i_k) \in \mathbb{Z}^k\).
  \end{itemize}

  This is similar to the partial differential operator from Definition \ref{def:pdo}, except that if \(j = 0\), the last row and column is omitted from the matrix.
\item
  The rest of the function sets up the input polynomials, projection polynomials and projection factors necessary to define a sign-invariant CAD compatible with \(V\) and critical points of projections of one- and two-dimensional cells onto one- and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces. Projections of the new polynomials computed in the previous two steps are computed and added to the projection polynomial and projection factor sets.
  The lifting phase proceeds, using these polynomials, us usual.
\end{itemize}

The function considers each \(2\)-dimensional cell \(C\) of \(\mathcal{E}\) such that \(C\subset V\). \(C\) is an \((i_1,\ldots,i_r)\)-cell such that \(i_j = i_k = 1\) and all other elements of the index are equal to zero.

\item
  The remainder of the function computes the refinements of \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{k\}}}}(C)_T\) and \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{k\}}}}(C)_T\), if they exist, such that \(C\) is monotone.

\texttt{LagrangeRefinement} is applied to \texttt{P} and then to each polynomial in \texttt{Fs}. On each step, the Jacobi determinant \(Q\), defined in Equation \eqref{eq:jacobi-det}, is computed. Using CAD projection, a set of univariate polynomials defining the \(x_1\)-coordinates of the solutions to \(Q = 0\) is then returned. Since the degree of \(Q\) may be high, it was noticed that computing a Groebner basis, using Singular, for \(Q\) and \texttt{Gs} significantly sped up the computation of the univariate polynomials (from several seconds to less than a second).

Once the set of refinement points has been computed, the CAD is refined using the method described in Section \ref{sec:implementation-refinement}.

\subsection{Frontier Condition}\label{frontier-condition}}

The frontier condition is obtained by using the generalisation of Lazard's method for lifting with bad points, as described in section \ref{sec:lazard-n}, the entry point for computing a CAD with frontier condition is \texttt{FRONTIER}. This function identifies bad zero-dimensional cells and adds refinement points, in the same format as that used in the construction of monotone cells.

\item
  Lines 6-12 determine if bad cells are possible. I.e., if the dimension of the sub-CAD above \texttt{D} is greater than \(3\) and if there is more than one child cell, since bad cells can only occur above \(0\)-cells.
\item
  A note is kept of cells which were already refined (Line 14). This information is stored in the form \((j,i_1,\ldots,i_{k+1})\), where \((i_1,\ldots,i_{k+1})\) is the positional index of the cell \(C\) to be refined and \(j\) the index of the level-\((k+1)\) polynomial which vanishes identically over \(C\). This prevents the program computing the same refinement points multiple times, as the same bad cell may lie in the projection of the boundary of multiple \(2\)-dimensional cells.
\item
  The loop (Lines 24-36) considers each \(2\)-dimensional section cell \(C\) in this sub-CAD, with index \((0,\ldots,0,m_k,0,\ldots,0,m_\ell,0,\ldots,0)\) in the CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^r\) (ambient space) where \(m_k=m_\ell = 1\).
\item
  \texttt{SI} (Line 31) is a list \((i_{k+1},\ldots,i_r)\) where each \(i_j \in \mathbb{Z}\) is equal to the index of the first polynomial in \(\mathcal{A}_j\) which is equal to zero on \(C\), or \(-1\) if no such polynomial exists. In particular, \(i_k = i_\ell = 1\).
\item
  Bad cells, in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{\ell}}}(C) \right)}\), may lie in the sub-CADs above the \((0,\ldots,0)\)-cells \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(C)_B\) and \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}(C)_T\).

This function proceeds by induction, recursing on zero-dimensional cells above \texttt{C} whose signature (indices of projection factors which are equal to zero) matches \texttt{S}. Note that coordinates \(i\) and \(j\) of \texttt{S} are equal to \(-1\), so any zero-dimensional cells at those levels are candidates for being bad cells. Lines 45-59 process possible bad cells. A bad cell is a \((0,...,0,1)\)-cell of level greater than \(j\), which has not yet been refined, and such that a polynomial vanishes identically on it.
The function \texttt{LazardLifting} uses \texttt{Singular} to compute the Groebner basis for the saturations of two ideals
\[
I_1 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-3}}, g_{\ell_2}, 1 - z g_{\ell_1} \rangle \cap \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k]
\]
and
\[
I_2 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-3}}, g_{\ell_1}, 1 - z g_{\ell_2} \rangle \cap \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_k],
\]
as described in Section \ref{sec:lazard-n}. To obtain a refinement polynomial in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_r]\), the sample point of the bad \((0,\ldots,0)\)-cell is substituted.
\texttt{ADDREFINEMENTPOINTS} is then called, taking these polynomials as input, the add the refinement points above this bad cell.

\hypertarget{sec:implementation-refinement}{%
\subsection{Refinement}\label{sec:implementation-refinement}}

Given the CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) constructed in the lifting phase, both \texttt{MONOTONE()} and \texttt{FRONTIER()} produces a set of refinement points
\[
{\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} = \{ c_1,\ldots,c_t \} \subset \mathbb{A}\mid \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{k-1} \text{ is a } (0,\ldots,0) \text{-cell in the decomposition induced by } {\cal D} \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^k \}.
\]
The function \texttt{REFINE()} computes refinements of \(\mathcal{D}\) to be compatible with these points. Each refinement point \((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1},c) \in \mathbb{A}^k\), such that \((b_1,\ldots,b_k)\) is a \(0\)-dimensional cell, \(\mathbf{b}\), in the CAD induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\) is stored separately, is stored separately as a pair
\[
((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1},c), (m_1,\ldots,m_{k-1},m_k))
\]
where \((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1})\) is the sample point, and \((m_1,\ldots,m_{k-1})\) is the positional index of the \(0\)-cell \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(c\) refines the \((1)\)-cell in the sub-CAD of \(\mathcal{D}\) above \(\mathcal{b}\) with positional index \((m_k)\).
\((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1},c)\) is stored as a QEPCAD sample point.
If all of \((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1})\) are rational, or are elements of the same algebraic extension, \(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\), as the sample point of the cell \(\mathbf{b}\), as \(c\), then \((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1},c)\) is a QEPCAD sample point in the primitive representation. If \((b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1}) \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) and \(c \not \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\) then \((c_1,\ldots,b_{k-1},c)\) is a QEPCAD sample point stored in extended representation.
The refinement point \(c\) is a root of a polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{Q}[x_k]\), computed by \texttt{MONOTONE()} or \texttt{FRONTIER()}. This polynomial is stored in the projection polynomial set, and its factors in the projection factor set.

The function \texttt{REFINE} computes the refinements.

QEPCAD represents a CAD \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) as a tree of cells. The root is the unique cell \(\mathbf{0}\) in the CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^0\) and its children are the cells of the CAD induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^1\). As one might expect, given a QEPCAD cell \(C\) in the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\), its children are the cells of the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\) which project on \(C\). QEPCAD constructs a ``partial CAD''. This means that there may be cells of level \(k < n\) with no children.
In other words, if \(C\) is an \((i_1,\ldots,i_k)\)-cell in the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k\) with no children, then \({\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}}^{-1}(C)\) is an \((i_1,\ldots,i_k,1,\ldots,1)\)-cell of \(\mathcal{D}\).

Refine proceeds by induction on CAD cells by ``walking'' the CAD (in the same way as a depth-first-search), identifying cells which need refinement by checking the level-\(k\) refinement points, computing this refinement and returning the refined CAD.

  \texttt{NextPolynomial()}, called on, e.g., Line 9, is a helper function for retrieving the next refinement point.
  Recall that \(\mathbf{b} = (b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1},c)\) is a QEPCAD sample point such that \texttt{PI} is its isolating interval and \texttt{PM} the minimal polynomial for \(c\). If \(c\) is rational, \(I = (c,c)\). \texttt{J} is the isolating interval containing \(c \in \mathbb{A}\). \texttt{j} is the index of the child cell which requires refinement.
\item
  Suppose that \(C\) is the cell with index \(j\). Then \texttt{S0M} and \texttt{S0I}, set on line 24, are the minimal polynomial and isolating interval, respectively, for the sample point of \(C_B\). The function \texttt{GETSAMPLEK} is a helper function responsible for retrieving this information. The first argument indicates the coordinate to retrieve, with \(-1\) being shorthand for last coordinate.
\item
  \texttt{RefineCell}, called on line 32, takes a list of cells, \((C,C_T, \ldots,C_\ell)\), where \(C\) is the cell to be refined and returns a list \((C_1,C_2,C_3,C_T,\ldots,C_\ell)\). The sample points are updated for \(C_1\) and \(C_2\). The flag \texttt{refine\_after} is set to \texttt{true} if the sample point of \(C_3\), which is still equal to the sample point of \(C\) at this point, is incorrect.
\item
  Some new projection factors, whose roots are the refinement points, were added to the projection factor set, but cell signatures have not yet been updated to reflect this. \texttt{ADDSIGNPF} (called on lines 40 and 54) is responsible for ensuring that the signs of these polynomials are attached to refined cells. If a cell is not refined, this information will not be needed.
\item
  Lines 45-53 update the sample point of \(C_3\), if needed.
\item
  During the loop in which cells are refined (Lines 7-55), the positional indices for refined cells are not updated. This is so that the index attached to refinement points still refers to the correct positional index. Lines 57-64 updates the positional indices for all children, using the helper function \texttt{SETINDEXK}.

This function lets \(C = C_1\) and inserts two copies \(C_1,C_2\) of \(C\) into the list of children. It then updates sample points, if needed (the sample point of \(C\) is correct for exactly one of \(C_1\), \(C_2\) or \(C_3\)), and adds missing signs of projection factors whose roots are the refinement points.
The comments explain how the function works. The helper function \texttt{LDCOPY} (list ``deep'' copy) makes a copy of each element in a list, proceeding by induction if the element is a list. This is required as \(C_2,C_3\) should not contain any pointers to data in \(C\). The functions \texttt{SETINDEXK}, \texttt{GETSAMPLEK} and \texttt{SETSAMPLEK} were discussed in relation to \texttt{RefineSubcad}.

\hypertarget{obtaining-defining-formulas-for-every-cell}{%
\subsection{Obtaining defining formulas for every cell}\label{obtaining-defining-formulas-for-every-cell}}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:cell-formula}, the projection factors may not be sufficient to produce a quantifier-free Boolean formula for every cell \(C\) in a CAD.
We would like to be able to examine every cell \(C \subset V_1,\ldots,V_k\) using its defining formula.
As such, a new command, \texttt{d-cell-tarski} has been implemented.
This uses Brown's solution formula construction algorithm for guaranteed solution formula construction. Given a CAD \(\mathcal{D}\), the algorithm builds an RCad \(\mathcal{D}_R\), which is a refinement of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that each cell can be expressed as a disjoint union of basic semialgebraic sets using only polynomials from the projection factor set.
In most cases, each cell can be written as a basic semialgebraic set (conjunction of sign conditions on polynomials), but occasionally, a cell \(C\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) is refined in \(\mathcal{D}_R\).
In both cases, every cell \(C\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) can be expressed as a quantifier-free Boolean formula
\[
F_1 \lor \ldots \lor F_k
\]
where \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) are conjunctions of polynomial equations and inequalities defining the cells \(C_1,\ldots,C_k\) of \(\mathcal{D}_R\) such that \(C = C_1\cup\ldots\cup C_k\).
The RCad is constructed when \texttt{d-cell-tarski} is used and then it is cached. If refinements to the original CAD are performed, e.g., because of \texttt{MONOTONE} or \texttt{FRONTIER}, the RCad is invalidated and must be reconstructed (see Line 77 of the \texttt{QEPCAD} function).

To demonstrate \texttt{d-cell-tarski}, construct a CAD compatible with \[
V := \{ x = y^2 - 2y \}.
\]
QEPCAD produces the following projection factors

\begin{verbatim}
d-proj-fac
P_1,1  = fac(J_1,1) = fac(dis(A_2,1))
       = 27 x^2 - 32


A_2,1  = input
       = y^3 - 2 y - x
\end{verbatim}

Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{A}\) be the unique roots of \(27x^2 - 32\) in the intervals \((-1115/1024,-557/512)\) and \((557/512, 1115/1024)\) respectively. The cylinder \((a,b) \times \mathbb{R}\) contains three true cells, on which \(x = y^3 - 2y\) is equal to zero. It is not possible to represent these three cells as QFFs containing only the projection factors, although their positional indices and sample points may be used to distinguish them. We show the output of \texttt{d-cell-tarski} for the true cell with positional index \((3,2)\).

The cell \(C\) has been refined into three cells in the RCad, and it can be represented by the QFF
\begin{align*}
& (g < 0 \ \land\ x > 0\ \land\ f = 0\ \land\ y < 0)\ \lor\\
& (x = 0\ \land\ f = 0\ \land\ y < 0)\ \lor \\
& (g < 0\ \land\ x < 0\ \land\ f = 0\ \land\ y < 0)
\end{align*}
where \(g := 27 x^2 - 32\) and \(f := y^3 - 2 y - x\). Note that the polynomial \(3 y^2 - 2\) is greater than zero at all points in \(C\), so it can be omitted from the formula.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variable \texttt{PCMCT} indicates that a monotone CAD should be computed if it is equal to \(1\), and runs the standard algorithm otherwise.
\item
  The first modification occurs on Lines 41-51, where standard projection is replaced by quasi-affine projection. The function \texttt{QUASIAFFINE} is called and the input polynomials, projection polynomials and projection factors are updated as necessary.
\item
  Lines 55-61 remain unchanged, and construct a truth-invariant CAD. If monotone cells are to be produced, the CAD will have constant sign on the projection factors, as the option \texttt{full-cad} will be enabled.
\item
  Lines 61-88 define a new step, where refinements for monotone cells and frontier condition are performed. Lines 70-71 compute the refinement points for monotone cells, by calling \texttt{MONOTONE} and Line 74 calls \texttt{REFINE} to compute the refinement. Line 84 calls \texttt{FRONTIER} to complete the refinement points above bad cells and Line 85 calls computes the refinement.

The sphere is decomposed into 26 cylindrical cells: 8 2-dimensional cells, 12 1-dimensional cells and 6 0-dimensional cells.

In Example \ref{exm:qanm}, we present a \(2\)-dimensional section cell which is the graph of a quasi-affine map, but is not a monotone cell.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:qanm}{}\label{exm:qanm}Let \(n = 3\) and consider the 2-dimensional section cell
\[
C := \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, y > 0, x + y^2 < 1, z = x^2 + y^2 \}.
\]
\end{example}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Quasi-affine}:

  \(C\) is already the graph of a quasi-affine map.
\item
  \textbf{Monotone}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \((1,1)\)-cell \(C' := {\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}}(C)\) is already monotone, since its bottom \(C'_B = \{ -1 < x < 1, y = 0 \}\) and top \(C'_T = \{ -1 < x < 1, y = 1 - x \}\) are independent of and strictly decreasing in \(x\) respectively.
  \item
    \(C_B = \{ -1 < x < 1, y = 0, z = x^2 \}\) is already monotone,
  \item
    \(C_T = \{ -1 < x < 1, y = 1-x, z = x^2 + y^2 \}\) is not monotone, since it intersects the plane \(\{z = c\}, 1/2 < c < 1\) in two points. The algorithm will find the critical points of \(f := z - y^2 - x^2 = 0\) subject to \(g := y + x - 1 = 0\) in the interval \(0 < x < 1\). These are the points at which
    \[
    \det \begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial g}{x} & \dfrac{\partial g}{y}\\
    \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}
    \end{pmatrix}=\det\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\
    2x & 2y
    \end{pmatrix}=2x-2y = x-y.
      \]
    Since \(x - y = 0\) and \(x + y - 1\) intersect at \(x = 1/2\), the refinement polynomial \(2x - y = 0\) is produced.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Frontier Condition}:

  No blow-up points, already satisfied.
\end{itemize}

Example \ref{exm:whitney-jhd} (\citet{jhd20}, Example 2.1) illustrated a CAD which fails to satisfy the frontier condition due to a blow-up point.
The cell shown in the example is part of the Whitney umbrella, and, unlike the examples considered so far, its frontier is not homeomorphic to a circle.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:fr-3-whitney-jhd}{}\label{exm:fr-3-whitney-jhd}\citep[Example 2.1]{jhd20}

Let \(n = 3\) and consider the \((1,1,0)\)-cell
\[
C = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, -x < y < x, y^2 - x^2 z = 0 \}.
\]
\end{example}

Quasi-affine**:

critical points of
- \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x,y\}}}}: z = 0\)
- \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{x,z\}}}}: y = 0\)
- \({\operatorname{proj}_{{\operatorname{span} \{y,z\}}}}: x = 0\)
- \textbf{Monotone}:

\(C\) is partitioned, in the quasi-affine step, into three cells
\begin{align}
  C_1 &= \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, -x < y < 0, y^2 - x^2 z = 0 \},\\
  C_2 &= \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, y = 0, y^2 - x^2 z = 0 \},\\
  C_3 &= \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < x, y^2 - x^2 z = 0 \},\\
  \end{align}
each of which is already monotone.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Frontier Condition}:

  there is one bad point, \(\mathbf{b} = (0,0)\) in the decomposition induced on \(\mathbb{R}^2\), above which the polynomial \(y^2 - x^2 z\) vanishes identically.
  The CAD contains three cells projecting on \(\mathbf{b}\):
  \begin{align}
  B_1 &= \{ (0,0,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid z < 0 \},\\
  B_2 &= \{ (0,0,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid z = 0 \},\\
  B_3 &= \{ (0,0,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid z > 0 \}.\\
  \end{align}
  This CAD does not satisfy the frontier condition.
  Indeed, we have
  \[
  B := B_3 \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( ( \right)}C_1) = B_3 \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( ( \right)}C_2)
  \] which is not a cell of the CAD.
  According to Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-13} (\citet{lazard10}, Proposition 5.13), the following situation should occur:

  \begin{quote}
  there exists a cell \(E\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) such that \(\dim(E) < \dim(C_1) = \dim((C_2)\) and \(\emptyset \neq B_3 \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left(  E  \right)} \neq B_3\).
  \end{quote}

  For \(C_1\), the cell \(E\) in question is the \((1,0,0)\)-cell \(\{ 0 < x < 1, x + y = 0, z = 1 \}\),
  and for \(C_3\), \(E\) is the \((1,0,0)\)-cell \(\{ 0 < x < 1, x - y = 0, z = 1 \}\)
  In both cases, \({\operatorname{fr} \left( ( \right)}E) \cap B_3 = (0,0,1)\) -- the required refinement point.

  \citet{lazard10}, Algorithm 5.15 is then applied, resulting in the computation of the following saturations:
  \begin{align}
  I_1 &:= \{ y^2 - x^2 z, x, 1 - y t \} \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z], \\
  I_2 &:= \{ y^2 - x^2 z, y, 1 - x t \} \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z], \\
  I_3 &:= \{ y^2 - x^2 z, x, 1 - (x + y) t \} \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z], \\
  I_4 &:= \{ y^2 - x^2 z, x + y, 1 - x t \} \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z], \\
  I_5 &:= \{ y^2 - x^2 z, x, 1 - (x - y) t \} \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z], \\
  I_6 &:= \{ y^2 - x^2 z, x - y, 1 - x t \} \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z], \\
  \end{align}
  where \(t\) is a new variable.

  The Groebner basis for \(I_2\) contains the polynomial \(z\), which defines the refinement point \((0,0,0)\), which is already a cell in the CAD.
  The Groebner bases for \(I_4\) and \(I_6\) both contain \(z-1\), defining the refinement point \((0,0,1)\), which was identified by Lemma \ref{lem:lazard-5-13}.
\end{itemize}

Part of the QEPCAD output is now presented. In particular the projection factors, refinement points and the collection of cells which comprises the frontier of \(C\).

\chapter{A novel algorithm for obtaining the frontier condition on a cylindrical decomposition of n-dimensional space}\label{sec:novel-frontier}}

So far, we have been concerned only with cylindrical algebraic decompositions compatible with subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) having dimension at most two. We will now present a novel algorithm for obtaining the frontier condition on a cylindrical algebraic decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with a set of arbitrary dimension.

We begin by presenting some examples of cylindrical cells and their frontiers. Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical} provides motivation for this novel algorithm.
Many cylindrical section cells are well-behaved, with their top and bottom being cylindrical section cells.
For example, consider
\[
C := \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, f(x,y) > 0, g(x,y) < 0, z = \varphi(x,y) \}
\]
where \(f(x,y) = y, g(x,y) = x + y - 1\) and \(\varphi(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\).
The projection of \(C\) onto \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is a cylindrical sector cell
\[
C' = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid 0 < x < 1, f(x,y) > 0, g(x,y) < 0 \}
\]
with the bottom, \(C'_B\), of \(C'\) being the graph of \(f\) and the top, \(C'_T\), of \(C'\) being the graph of \(g\). It is clear that \(\varphi\vert_{C'_B}\) and \(\varphi\vert_{C'_T}\) is a continuous function, hence \(C_B\) and \(C_T\) are cylindrical section cells.
Sometimes the bottom and top may fail to exist. This can happen if a cell is not bounded from below or above, or if the function of which a section cell is the graph tends to infinity. For example, the section cell
\[
C = \{ (x,y,z) \mid x > 0, y > 0, y z - 1 = 0 \}
\]
has no top or bottom. Firstly, note that the projection, \(C'\), of \(C\) onto \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is not bounded from above, hence \(C_T\) does not exist. Secondly, at every point of \(C'_B = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x > 0, y = 0 \}\), \(yz - 1 = 0\) is not defined as the \(z\)-coordinate of \(C\) tends to infinity as \(y\) approaches zero.
A more interesting situation arises when there is a blow-up in the top or bottom of a section cell, as shown in Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}, reproduced below.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}{}\label{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}\citep[Example 3.2]{bgv15}
Let
\[
C' = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid -1 < x < 1, \vert x\vert < y < 1 \}
\]
be a cylindrical sector cell in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and \(C\) be the graph of \(\varphi\vert_{C'}\), where
\[
\varphi(x,y) = \vert x/y\vert.
\]
\(C\) is a cylindrical section cell in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), according to Definition \ref{def:cells}, despite the fact that \(\varphi\vert_{C'}\) is not analytic.
Consider the bottom of \(C\)
\[C_B = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid -1 < x < 1, x \ne 0, y = \vert x\vert, z = 1 \} \cup \{(0,0,z) \mid 0\le z \le 1\}.\]
Due to the blow-up of \(\varphi\) at the origin, \(C_B\) is not a cylindrical cell.
Note that \(C_B\) does not contain all points at which \(\varphi\) vanishes.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}

\caption{$C$, with ${\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}$ superimposed, from Example \\ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}, demonstrating that $C_B$ is not the graph of a continuous function.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-8}
\end{figure}

As discussed above, in relation to Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}, the frontier of a cylindrical cell
can be geometrically nontrivial, e.g., it may contain a blow-up.

\section{Statement of the Problem}\label{statement-of-the-problem}}

Semialgebraic sets will usually be represented by Quantifier-Free Boolean formulas (QFFs) (see Definition \ref{def:qff}).
Occasionally, First-Order formulas, a wider class of formulas in which some variables may be bound by quantifiers \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) (see Definition \ref{def:first-order-formula}).

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:main}{}\label{thm:main}Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a QFF \(F\) with \(s\) different polynomials of maximum degree \(d\) in \(\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(F\) as input, which outputs a cylindrical decomposition \(\mathcal D\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with \(S\) and
satisfying the frontier condition.
The complexity of this algorithm is \((sd)^{O(1)^{n2^n}}\).
This is also an upper bound on the number of cells in \(\mathcal D\), number of polynomials defining cells and their degrees.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
The algorithm from Theorem \ref{thm:main} is understood as a Blum-Shub-Smale (BSS) real numbers machine \citep{blum1998}.
A similar statement is also true for the Turing machine model, in which case the complexity bound
depends, in addition, polynomially on maximal bit-size of coefficients (cf.~\citet{collins1975}).
\end{remark}

The following result, which is somewhat natural and is also mentioned by \citet{bgv15} will be proved. This will allow us to apply Theorem \ref{thm:main} directly to semialgebraic sets defined by first-order Boolean formulas with quantifiers.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:proj}{}\label{thm:proj}Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with a semialgebraic set \(S\subset \mathbb{R}^n\) and satisfying the frontier condition.
Then the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{k}\) for all \(1\le k < n\) is a cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^k\) compatible with \(\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^k}(S)\) and satisfying the frontier condition.
\end{theorem}

This will allow us to apply Theorem \ref{thm:main} to semialgebraic sets represented by first-order Boolean formulas (with quantifiers) and obtain a decomposition compatible with \(S\) and satisfying the frontier condition.

\subsection{Computing the frontier of a semialgebraic set}\label{sec:novel-frontier-fr}}

We presentd the classical CAD algorithm due to \citet{collins1975}, as formulated in \citet{bpr2006}, Algorithm 11.2, in \ref{prp:collins}.
Given a set of \(s\) different polynomials with maximum degree \(d\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n\), this algorithm has complexity
\[
(sd)^{O(1)^{n}}.
\]
This is also an upper bound on the number of polynomials, their maximum degree, and the number of cells in the CAD it produces.
Several variants of the classical CAD algorithm exist. The most convenient version for our situation takes as input a set \(\{ F_1,\ldots,F_k \}\) of QFF and returns a CAD compatible with each set \(S_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) represented by the formula \(F_i\), \(1 \le i \le k\). The same bounds on complexity, number of cells, number of polynomials and degrees as obtained in Proposition \ref{prp:collins} is obtained, where \(s\) is the number of different polynomials appearing in formulas \(F_1,\ldots,F_k\) and \(d\) is their maximum degree.
An algorithm for constructing such a CAD is presented by \citet{collins1991}, and an alternative approach is presented by \citet{bradford2014}.

The following algorithm allows us to compute the frontier of \(S\): \({\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)}={\operatorname{cl} \left( S \right)} \setminus S\)
It is a straightforward application of a singly exponential quantifier elimination algorithm.

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:frontier}{}\label{lem:frontier}Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be a semialgebraic set defined by a QFF \(F\)
containing \(s\) different polynomials in \(\mathbb{R}[x_1, \ldots ,x_n]\) having maximum degree \(d\).
There is an algorithm, taking \(F\) as input, which represents the semialgebraic set \({\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)}\) by a QFF \(F'\) with complexity \((sd)^{O(n^2)}\).
This is also an upper bound on the number of polynomials in \(F'\) and their degrees.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Observe that \({\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)}\) can be represented by a first-order Boolean formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:frontier-first-order}
{\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)} = \left\{ \mathbf{x} \in (\mathbb{R}^n \setminus S) \mid \forall \varepsilon >0\> \exists \mathbf{y} \in S\> (\Vert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \Vert < \varepsilon ) \right\}.
\end{equation}
Using singly-exponential quantifier elimination algorithm \citep[Algorithm 14.21]{bpr2006}, we represent \({\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)}\)
as a QFF \(F'\) with the bounds required in the lemma.
\end{proof}

\hypertarget{intermediate-results}{%
\subsection{Intermediate Results}\label{intermediate-results}}

Recall that, according to Definition \ref{def:cells}, to each cylindrical cell in a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) a (multi-)index
\((i_1, \ldots ,i_n) \in \{ 0,1 \}^n\) is assigned.
Introduce a lexicographic order \(<_{\rm{lex}}\) on the set of all cell indices as follows.
For any two indices, \(M:=(i_1,\ldots,i_n)\) and \(N:=(j_1,\ldots,j_n)\), we set \(M <_{\rm{lex}}N\)
iff for the maximal \(k,\ 0 \le k <n\), such that \(i_1=j_1, \ldots, i_k=j_k\) we have \(i_{k+1} < j_{k+1}\).
If \(M <_{\rm{lex}}N\) or \(M = N\), we write \(M \le_{\rm{lex}}N\).

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:fr-lex-less}{}\label{lem:fr-lex-less}Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and let \(C\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) with index \(M\).
Then \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is contained in a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D}\) with indices lexicographically less than \(M\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Proceed by induction on \(n\).

When \(n=1\), the cell \(C\) either has index \(M=(0)\) or \(M=(1)\).
If \(M=(0)\) then \(C\) is a single point and its frontier is empty.
If \(M=(1)\), \(C\) is an open interval. By the definition of CAD, endpoints of \(C\) are \((0)\)-cells.

Now let \(n>1\) and let \(C\) have index \(M=(i_1,\ldots,i_n)\).
The projection \(C'=\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}(C)\) is a cell in the induced decomposition \(\mathcal{D'}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\)
with index \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})\).
By the induction hypothesis, \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)}\) is contained in a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D'}\) with indices
\((j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1}) <_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})\). I.e., by definition we have
\begin{equation}
i_1=j_1,\ldots,i_{k-1} = j_{k-1} \text{ and } i_k < j_k \text{ for some } 1 \le k \le n - 1.
\label{eq:fr-lex-less-hyp}
\end{equation}

If \(i_n=0\), then \(C\) is a section cell.
Its frontier \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is contained in \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)} \times \mathbb{R}\) and, therefore, in a union of
cells of \(\mathcal D\) with indices \((j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1}, j_n)\) for some \(j_n \in \{ 0,1 \}\).
Since the property in Equation \eqref{eq:fr-lex-less-hyp} still holds, we have shown that \((j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1}, j_n) <_{\rm{lex}}M\).

If \(i_n=1\), then \(C\) is a sector cell.
In this case, \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is contained in \(({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)} \times \mathbb{R}) \cup C_T \cup C_B\), hence in the
union of cells of \(\mathcal D\) with indices \((j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1}, j_n)\) for some \(j_n \in \{0,1\}\),
and two cells, \(C_T\) and \(C_B\), having the same index \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0) <_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\).
All of these indices are lexicographically less than \(M\).
\end{proof}

In the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main}, we will need the following technical statement.

\begin{lemma}
\protect\hypertarget{lem:section-split}{}\label{lem:section-split}Let \(f: X \to \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous definable function on a set
\(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) having the graph \(F \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\), such that \(F\) is a semialgebraic set.
Let \(G\) be a semialgebraic subset, closed in \(F\), of dimension less than \(\dim (F)=n\).
Then \({\rm{fr}}_{F}(F \setminus G) = G\), where \({\rm{fr}}_F\) denotes the frontier in \(F\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(Y = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(G)\) and observe that \(X = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(F)\) and, since semialgebraic sets are closed under projection, observe that both \(X\) and \(Y\) are semialgebraic.
We will prove that \({\rm{fr}}_X(X \setminus Y) = Y\).
By the definition of frontier, we have
\[{\rm{fr}}_X(X \setminus Y)={\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Y) \setminus (X \setminus Y),\]
where \({\rm{cl}}_X\) denotes the closure in \(X\).

We need to prove that \({\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Y) = X\).
Since \(Y\) is a semialgebraic set, it is the union of some basic semialgebraic sets
\begin{equation}
S_i = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, f_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_\ell(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}
\label{eq:basic-semialgebraic}
\end{equation}
of dimension \(< n\).
Each \(S_i\) is contained in a hypersurface \(V_i = V(f_{i})\), where \(f_i\) is one of the polynomial equations defining \(S_i\) in Equation \eqref{eq:basic-semialgebraic}.
Let \(Z = \bigcup_i V_i = \bigcup_i V(f_{i}) = V(\prod f_i)\) be a closed set which contains \(Y\).
We may replace \(Y\) with \(Z\), and prove that
\[
{\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Z) = X \supset Z \cap X
\]
because \((X \setminus Z) \subset (X \setminus Y)\) implies \({\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Z) \subset {\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Y)\).

When considering \({\rm{cl}}_X\), we view \(X\) as a topological space and consider only the points of \(Z\) which are contained in \(X\).

We prove that
\[
Z \cap {\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Z) \supset Z \cap X
\]
and claim that every \(\mathbf{x} \in X \cap Z\) is a point of \({\rm{cl}}_X(X \setminus Z)\).
I.e., since we view \(X\) as a topological space, even if \(X\) is not an open set, by the definition of closure, there is a small real number \(r > 0\) such that the open ball \(B(\mathbf{x},r)\) is contained in \(X \setminus Z\).
Assume for contradiction that this is false. Then \(B(\mathbf{x}, r) \cap (X \setminus Z) = \emptyset\).
It follows that \(B(\mathbf{x},r)\) must be contained in \(Z\), but this is impossible because a set of dimension \(< n\) cannot contain an \(n\)-dimensional open ball.

Finally, since \(f\) is a continuous function, and therefore \(Y\) and \(X\) are homeomorphic to \(G\) and \(F\)
respectively, we obtain the required formula \({\rm{fr}}_{F}(F \setminus G) = G\).
\end{proof}

We now prove that the decomposition induced on \(\mathbb{R}^k, 1 \le k \le n-1\) by any CAD satisfying the frontier condition also satisfies the frontier condition.

\begin{proof}
(of Theorem \ref{thm:proj})

Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be the cylindrical decomposition of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) which satisfies the frontier condition and let \(\mathcal{D}'\) be the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\).
Let \(C'\) be a cell of \(\mathcal{D}'\). We claim that \(C'\) satisfies the frontier condition and prove that \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D'}\).
Consider the cylinder \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\).
\({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)}\) can be written as a first-order Boolean formula
\begin{equation}
(\mathbf{x'},x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \forall \varepsilon > 0\> \exists (\mathbf{y'},y_n) \in C' \times \mathbb{R}\> (\Vert (\mathbf{x'},x_n) - (\mathbf{y'},y_n) \Vert < \varepsilon ).
\label{eq:closure-quantifiers}
\end{equation}
Since \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D}\) and \(\mathcal{D}\) satisfies the frontier condition,
it follows that every point \((\mathbf{x'},x_n) \in {\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)}\) belongs to \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C \right)}\) for some cell \(C\) of \(\mathcal{D}\) in \(C' \times \mathbb{R}\). Hence, \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D}\).

It is clear that, if \((\mathbf{x'}, x_n) \in {\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)}\), then \(\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}((\mathbf{x'}, x_n)) = \mathbf{x'} \in \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)})\). Hence \(\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)}) = {\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \right)}\) and, by the cylindrical property, since \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \times \mathbb{R} \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D}\), \({\operatorname{cl} \left( C' \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{D'}\).

The proof is completed, for decompositions induced by \(\mathcal{D}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^k, 1 \le k \le n-1\), by iterating this argument for successive projections.

We demonstrate the \(\mathrm{CadFC}\) algorithm by applying it to the set
\[
S := \{ -1 < x < 1, \vert x\vert <y <1, z=\vert x/y\vert \}
\]
from Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Let \(F\) be a QFF defining \(S\) and compute \(\mathcal{E} := \mathbf{true}\ \&\ \{F\}\), a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) compatible with \(S\) (see Table \ref{tab:cells-of-e} and Figure \ref{fig:initial-cad}). Observe that \(S\) is a single 2-dimensional cylindrical \((1,1,0)\)-cell of \(\mathcal{E}\).
  The initial pair \[
  (\mathcal{E}_{(1,1)}, \mathcal{F}_{(1,1)}) = (\mathcal{E}, \emptyset).
  \]
\item
  We compute the next pair \((\mathcal{E}_{(1,0)}, \mathcal{F}_{(1,0)})\).
  \[\mathcal{E}_{(1,0)} := \mathcal{E}_{(1,1)}\ \&\ \mathcal{F}_{(1,1)} = \mathcal{E}\ \&\ \emptyset = \mathcal{E}.
  \]
  Denote by \(X_{(1,0)}\) the set of frontiers of cells of \(\mathcal{E}_{(1,0)}\) with indices \((1,1,1)\) and \((1,1,0)\).
  This set contains
  \begin{align*}
  {\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)} = &\ S_B \cup S_T \cup \{ (-1,1,1), (1,1,1) \}\\
  \text{where }
  S_T = &\ \{ -1 < x < 1, y = 1, z = \vert x \vert \} \\
  \text{and }
  S_B = &\ \{ -1 < x < 0, y = -x, z = 1 \} \\
  \cup &\ \{ x = y = 0, 0 \le z \le 1 \} \\
  \cup &\ \{ 0 < x < 1, y = x, z = 1 \}
  \end{align*}
  (see Figure \ref{fig:initial-fr}). The family \(\mathcal{F}_{(1,0)}\) contains a QFF defining \(X_{(1,0)}\).
  Recall (from Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}) that \(S_B\) cannot be a cylindrical cell as it is not the graph of a continuous function.
\item
  Compute the next pair \((\mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}, \mathcal{F}_{(0,1)})\) as follows. Let
  \[
  \mathcal{E}_{(0,1)} := \mathcal{E}_{(1,0)}\ \&\ \mathcal{F}_{(1,0)}.
  \]
  The blow-up subset \(\{ x = y = 0, 0 \le z \le 1 \}\) in \(X_{(1,0)}\) results in a refinement of the decomposition induced by \(\mathcal{E}_{(1,0)}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^1\) such that it includes the cells \(\{-1 < x < 0\}, (0), \{ 0 < x < 1 \}\). Thus \(\mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}\) includes a cell \(S'' = \{ x = 0, 0 < y < 1, z = 0 \}\) and \(S\) is split into three cells \(S', S'', S'''\) with indices \((1,1,0),(1,0,0)\) and \((1,1,0)\) respectively.
  Cells \(C_1,C_2,C_3\) and \(C_4\) of \(\mathcal{E}_{(1,0)} = \mathcal{E}\) are also refined in this step so that they are compatible with \({\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)}\) (see Table \ref{tab:cells-of-e-refined} and Figure \ref{fig:final-cad}). As we will argue in the Correctness section, frontiers \({\rm{fr}}_S(S')\) and \({\rm{fr}}_S(S''')\) coincide with \(S''\), so no further refinements of cells with index \((1,1,1)\) and \((1,1,0)\) are needed.
  \(X_{(0,1)}\) contains \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C'_2 \right)}, {\operatorname{fr} \left( C'''_2 \right)}, {\operatorname{fr} \left( C'_3 \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C'''_3 \right)}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{F}_{(0,1)}\) contains QFFs defining \(X_{(0,1)}\).
\item
  In this particular case, \(X_{(0,1)}\) is already a union of cells of \(\mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}\), so \(\mathcal{E}_{(0,0)} = \mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}\) as no refinement is needed.
  \(X_{(0,0)}\) contains \({\operatorname{fr} \left( S' \right)}\).
\item
  \(X_{(0,0)}\) is already a union of cells of \(\mathcal{E}_{(0,0)}\), so no further refinement of \(\mathcal{E}_{(0,0)} = \mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}\) is needed. The algorithm terminates and returns \(\mathcal{D} := \mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}\).
\end{enumerate}

Well-known implementations of cylindrical algebraic decomposition such as \texttt{QEPCAD\ B} \citep{brownQepcad} and Maple's \texttt{CylindricalAlgebraicDecompose} \citep{chen2014} are unable to obtain the frontier condition in general. In particular, when applied to set \(S\) from Example \ref{exm:top-bottom-not-cylindrical}, both `CylindricalAlgebraicDecompose' and `QEPCAD B' create three cells above the origin: \(B' = \{ x = y = 0, z < 0\}\), \(B'' = \{ x = y = 0, z = 0\}\) and \(B''' = \{ x = y = 0, z > 0\}\). Observe that \(B''' \cap {\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)} \ne \emptyset\), but \(B''' \not \subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( S \right)}\) so the frontier of \(S\) is not a union of cells in the decomposition.

\subsection{Mathematical Description}\label{mathematical-description}}

The algorithm takes as input a quantifier-free Boolean formula \(F\) representing a semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\). Begin by computing a CAD \(\mathcal{E}\) compatible with \(S\), by applying the algorithm from Proposition \ref{prp:collins} to \(\{ F \}\).

The algorithm computes a sequence of pairs
\begin{equation}
({\mathcal E}_M,\ \mathcal{F}_M),
\label{eq:pair}
\end{equation}
where \(M = (i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1}) \in \{0,1\}^{n-1}\) is an index, \(\mathcal{E}_M\) is a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) which is a refinement of \(\mathcal{E}\) and \(\mathcal{F}_M\) is a family of quantifier-free Boolean formulas, each defining a semialgebraic set which is contained in the union of all cells of \({\mathcal E}_M\) with indices \(\le_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\). We will denote this family of cells by \(\mathcal{U}_M\).
In equation \eqref{eq:pair}, index \(M\) refers to the pair rather than its elements.

The sequence of pairs is computed recursively, starting with index \(M=(1,1, \ldots ,1)\),
in descending order of indices \(M=(i_1, \ldots, i_{n-1})\) with respect to \(<_{\rm{lex}}\).
Let the initial pair
\[({\mathcal E}_{(1, \ldots, 1)},\ \mathcal{F}_{(1, \ldots, 1)}) = ({\mathcal E},\ \emptyset).\]
The algorithm will construct the sequence (from right to left):
\begin{equation}
({\mathcal E}_{\mathbf{0}}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathbf{0}}) <_{\rm{lex}}\cdots <_{\rm{lex}}
({\mathcal E}_N, \mathcal{F}_N) <_{\rm{lex}}({\mathcal E}_M, \mathcal{F}_M)
<_{\rm{lex}}\cdots
<_{\rm{lex}}({\mathcal E} , \emptyset),
\label{eq:sequence}
\end{equation}
where \(\mathbf{0} = (0,\ldots,0)\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{\mathbf{0}} := \{ F \mid F \text{ is a QFF defining } C \in{\mathcal U}_{(0, \ldots ,0)} \}\). Note that the \(<_{\rm{lex}}\) notation is naturally extended to elements of the sequence defined in Equation \eqref{eq:sequence}.

For a given index \(M=(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})\), assume that the algorithm has computed the pair \((\mathcal{E}_M,\ \mathbf{F}_M)\).
Now we describe how the next pair, \(({\mathcal E}_N,\ \mathcal{F}_N)\), where \(N=(j_1, \ldots ,j_{n-1})\) is the index immediately prior to \(M\) with respect to \(<_{\rm{lex}}\), is computed.
Applying algorithm from Proposition \ref{prp:collins} to \({\mathcal E}_M\) and \(\mathcal{F}_M\), we obtain a CAD
\({\mathcal E}_{N}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with every cell of \({\mathcal E}_M\) and each set defined by QFFs in \(\mathcal{F}_M\)
(see construction of \(\mathcal{E}_{(0,1)}\) in Step 2 of the worked example).
Consider the family \({\mathcal A}_0\) of cells in \({\mathcal E}_{N}\) with indices \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)
(section cells)
and the family \({\mathcal A}_1\) of cells in \({\mathcal E}_{N}\) with indices \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\)
(sector cells).
Compute the set of frontiers
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:front}
X_{N} := \bigcup_{C \in {\mathcal A}_0}{\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} \cup \bigcup_{C \in {\mathcal A}_1}({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)} \setminus (C_T \cup C_B)).
\end{equation}
More precisely, apply the algorithm from Lemma \ref{lem:frontier} to each QFF defining a cell \(C \in \mathcal{A}_0\) and to the QFF defining \(C \setminus (C_T \cup C_B)\) where \(C \in \mathcal{A}_1\). Observe that \(C_T, C_B\) are already \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\)-cells in \(\mathcal{A}_0\).
According to Lemma \ref{lem:fr-lex-less}, \(X_{N}\) is contained in the union of cells in \({\mathcal E}_{N}\)
with indices \(\le_{\rm{lex}}(j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1},1) <_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\) (see construction of \(X_{(1,0)}\) in Step 1 of the worked example).

When the algorithm reaches the final pair \(({\mathcal E}_{\mathbf{0}}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathbf{0}})\) in the sequence,
it computes a CAD \(\mathcal D\), using the algorithm from Proposition \ref{prp:collins}, compatible
with \(\mathcal{F}_{\mathbf{0}}\) and every cell of \({\mathcal E}_{\mathbf{0}}\). The algorithm terminates by returning \(\mathcal D\).

\hypertarget{proof-of-correctness}{%
\subsection{Proof of correctness}\label{proof-of-correctness}}

\begin{proof}
(of Theorem \ref{thm:main})

Let \(L=(k_1, \ldots ,k_{n-1})\) be the index immediately prior to \(N=(j_1, \ldots ,j_{n-1} )\) with respect to \(<_{\rm{lex}}\).
The algorithm computes \({\mathcal E}_L\) as the refinement of \({\mathcal E}_N\) compatible with each set represented by a formula in \(\mathcal{F}_N\). This is the set \(X_N\) defined in Equation \eqref{eq:front}.
Suppose that the algorithm has computed the final decomposition \(\mathcal{D}\), as the refinement of \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{0}}\) compatible with \(\mathcal{F}_{\mathbf{0}}\) in the sequence \ref{eq:sequence}. Now construct a new sequence of decompositions (from left to right)
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}'_{\mathbf{0}} <_{\rm{lex}}\cdots <_{\rm{lex}}\mathcal{E}'_L <_{\rm{lex}}\mathcal{E}'_N <_{\rm{lex}}\mathcal{E}'_M <_{\rm{lex}}\cdots <_{\rm{lex}}\mathcal{E}'_{(1,\ldots,1)}
\label{eq:seq-ind-hyp}
\end{equation}
where the initial element \(\mathcal{E}'_{\mathbf{0}}\) is the refinement of \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{0}}\) compatible with each cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) and each \(\mathcal{E}'_I\) is the refinement of \(\mathcal{E}_I\) compatible with all cells of \(\mathcal{E}'_J\), where \(J\) is the index immediately prior to \(I\) with respect to \(<_{\rm{lex}}\).
We want to prove that every cell in \(\mathcal{E}'_L\) with index \(\le_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)\) satisfies the frontier condition.

If \(C\) is a cell in \({\mathcal E}_N\) with index \((i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1},0)\) (section cell),
then \(C\) is a union of cells of \({\mathcal E}_L\) and, hence, of \(\mathcal{E}'_L\), with indices \(\le_{\rm{lex}}(i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1} ,0)\).
Let \(C' \subset C\) be one of the cells in this refinement of \(C\) with index \((i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1} ,0)\) and \(B\) be
the union of cells contained in the refinement of \(C\) with indices \(<_{\rm{lex}}(i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1} ,0)\).
Let \(B' \subset B\) be a cell of \({\mathcal E}_L\) with index \((m_1,\ldots,m_{n-1},0) <_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\). We claim that \(\dim(B') < \dim(C)\).
Indeed, on the one hand, if \(i_k = 0\), for some \(1\le k \le n-1\), then \(m_k = 0\) as well. Otherwise, \(\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^k}(C)\) is a section cell which must contain \(\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^k}(B')\), which is a sector cell, but this is impossible.
On the other hand, by the definition of \(<_{\rm{lex}}\), there exists some \(1\le \ell \le n-1\) such that \(m_1 = i_1, \ldots, m_{\ell-1} = i_{\ell-1}\) and \(m_\ell = 0, i_\ell = 1\). This implies that \(\dim(B') = m_1 + \cdots + m_{n-1} < i_1 + \cdots + m_{n-1} = \dim(C)\) as required. It follows that \(\dim(B) < \dim(C)\) and \(B\) is closed in \(C\).
According to Lemma \ref{lem:section-split}, \({\rm{fr}}_C (C \setminus B)=B\) where \({\rm{fr}}_X(Y)\) denotes the frontier of \(Y\) in \(X\).
Hence, \({\rm{fr}}_C (C') \subset B\).
On the other hand, \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C' \right)} \setminus {\rm{fr}}_C (C')\) is a subset of \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\), which is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{E}_L\) (and of the refinement \(\mathcal{E}'_L\)) with index \(<_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\).

By the induction hypothesis, all cells of \(\mathcal{E}'_L\) with index \(<_{\rm{lex}}(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)\) satisfy the frontier condition. In particular, \({\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) and \({\operatorname{fr} \left( B \right)}\subset {\operatorname{fr} \left( C \right)}\) is a union of cells of \(\mathcal{E}'_L\).
It follows from the cylindrical structure of \(\mathcal{E}'_L\) that \(C'\) satisfies the frontier condition.

If \(C\) is a cell in \({\mathcal E}_N\) with index \((i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1} ,1)\) (sector cell),
then \(C\) is a union of cells of \({\mathcal E}_L\) with indices \(\le_{\rm{lex}}(i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1} ,1)\).
A similar argument to that used for section cells shows that each cell \(C'\) in this union,
having index \((i_1, \ldots ,i_{n-1} ,1)\), satisfies the frontier condition in \(\mathcal{E}'_L\). Note that when using
Lemma \ref{lem:section-split} we consider sector cell \(C\) as a graph of a constant function over itself.

Finally, each decomposition \(\mathcal{E}'_I\), \(I \in \{0,1\}^{n-1}\), in the sequence \ref{eq:seq-ind-hyp} coincides with \(\mathcal{D}\). Indeed, \(\mathcal{D}\) is a refinement of \(\mathcal{E}_I\) and \(\mathcal{E}'_I\) is a refinement of \(\mathcal{E}_I\) compatible with all cells of \(\mathcal{D}\). In other words, no refinement of \(\mathcal{D}\) is required to obtain \(\mathcal{E}'_{(1,\ldots,1)}\).
It follows that every cell of \(\mathcal{D}\) satisfies the frontier condition.
\end{proof}

\hypertarget{complexity}{%
\subsection{Complexity}\label{complexity}}

The number of different indices \((i_1, \ldots, i_n)\), where each \(i_k \in \{ 0,1 \}\), is \(2^n\).
Therefore, the algorithm makes \(O(2^n)\) ``steps'\,': computing successive pairs \(({\mathcal E}_M, \mathcal{F}_M)\) in the sequence (\ref{eq:sequence}).
In each step, we compute the next pair \((\mathcal{E}_N,\ \mathcal{F}_N)\) from \((\mathcal{E}_M,\ \mathcal{F}_M)\), using Proposition \ref{prp:collins} and Lemma \ref{lem:frontier}.

First, Proposition \ref{prp:collins} is applied to compute \(\mathcal{E}_N\), the CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) compatible with all cells of \(\mathcal{E}_M\) and the sets defined by formulas in \(\mathcal{F}_M\). The complexity of this operation depends on the number of polynomials, \(s_M\), and their maximum degree, \(d_M\), defining \((\mathcal{E}_M,\ \mathcal{F}_M)\).
The complexity of this operation is
\[
(s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n}.
\]
Since this is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials and their degrees defining \(\mathcal{E}_N\), let
\[
s_N:=(s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n} \text{ and } d_N:=(s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n}.
\]

We now compute the set of frontiers \(\mathcal{F}_N\) of cells of \(\mathcal{E}_M\) with index \((i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},i_n)\).
The complexity of applying Lemma \ref{lem:frontier} is
\((s_Md_M)^{n^2O(1)^n},\)
which is asymptotically the same as \((s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n}\).
Thus, the overall complexity of this ``step'' is again \[(s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n}.\]

The overall complexity is obtained by iterating this process for each index. E.g., the complexity of passing from \((\mathcal{E}_M\, \mathcal{F}_M)\) to \((\mathcal{E}_L\, \mathcal{F}_L)\), where \(M <_{\rm{lex}}N <_{\rm{lex}}L\) are subsequent indices in the lexicographical order, would be
\[
(s_Nd_N)^{O(1)^n} = \left((s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n}(s_Md_M)^{O(1)^n}\right)^{O(1)^n}
\]
Iterating this \(2^n\) times, with initial parameters \(s_{(1, \ldots,1)}=s\) and \(d_{(1, \ldots,1)}=d\) being the number of input polynomials and their maximum degree, we obtain an overall complexity of
\[
(sd)^{O(1)^{n2^n}}.
\]
According to Proposition \ref{prp:collins} and Lemma \ref{lem:frontier}, this is also an upper bound on the number of cells in \(\mathcal D={\mathcal E}_{\mathbf{0}}\), the number of polynomials defining cells and their degrees.

\hypertarget{a-note-on-constructing-the-intermediate-decompositions}{%
\subsection{A Note on Constructing the Intermediate Decompositions}\label{a-note-on-constructing-the-intermediate-decompositions}}

In the algorithm described in Theorem \ref{thm:main}, we construct, for each index \(M \in \{0,1\}^{n-1}\), a CAD compatible with \(\mathcal{F}_M = \{F_1,\ldots,F_k\}\) and all cells of \(\mathcal{E}_M\).
This can be achieved by constructing a CAD, using Proposition \ref{prp:collins}, such that each cell has constant sign on the polynomials in formulas \(\mathcal{F}_M\) and all cells of \(\mathcal{E}_M\). Such a CAD is clearly compatible with sets defined by formulas in \(\mathcal{F}_M\) and all cells of \(\mathcal{E}_M\). However, it may include some cells, outside \({\operatorname{cl} \left( S \right)}\), which we are not interested in.

Fewer cells may be produced by computing a CAD compatible with \(\{F_1,\ldots,F_k, C_1,\ldots,C_r\}\) where \(C_i,1\le i \le r\) is a cell of \(\mathcal{E}\) such that \(\bigcup_{1\le i \le r} C_i = \mathbb{R}^n\). This CAD is obviously compatible with all cells of \(\mathcal{E}_M\) and is compatible with the required sets.

Both options have the same asymptotic complexity. Therefore, the choice of CAD subroutine does not change the complexity bound obtained in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main}. We apply Proposition \ref{prp:collins} to compute a CAD compatible with the input set \(S\subset \mathbb{R}^n\) for the initial decomposition \(\mathcal{E}\)
The refinements are computed by applying a variant of the classical CAD algorithm which constructs a decomposition compatible with a family of sets.

In the algorithm description, we pass from semialgebraic sets (and CAD cells) to quantifier-free Boolean formulas.
This is clearly possible by Thom's Lemma. However, the signs of polynomials on which each CAD cell has constant sign may not be sufficient to properly define every cell in the CAD. Signs of polynomials defining the CAD will be sufficient to define every cell if Collins' augmented projection is used \{\citet{collins1975}{]}. The drawback, of course, is that more polynomials will be produced in the projection phase, which leads to more work during the lifting phase.
\citet{brown99} also presents an algorithm that ensures every cell can be represented by a formula containing projection polynomials and, possibly, a small number of derivatives. This may be preferable since fewer extra polynomials are needed.

\hypertarget{sec:pfaffian}{%
\subsection{Pfaffian Functions}\label{sec:pfaffian}}

Theorem \ref{thm:main} can be extended to restricted sub-Pfaffian sets as described by \citet{gv04}.
In particular, it can be used to prove the existence of decompositions with frontier condition compatible with semialgebraic sets defined by \emph{fewnomials} \citep[Section 2.6]{gv04}, whose structure is destroyed by a change of coordinates, and obtain a bound on the number of cells in these decompositions.

The idea of the proof is still valid. Only a modification to the subroutines for computing the frontier, and for constructing a classical CAD, is needed. For the former, replace the quantifier elimination algorithm in Lemma \ref{lem:frontier} with the result of \citep[Section 5]{gv04}. In the latter case, the classical CAD algorithm from Proposition \ref{prp:collins} should be replaced by the main result of \citet{gv01} (see also \citep[Section 7]{gv04}). The rest of the proof can be reproduced almost identically.
Care must be taken to ensure that Lemma \ref{lem:section-split} is still applicable to restricted sub-Pfaffian sets. The projection of a sub-Pfaffian set is a semi-Pfaffian set, which admits the representation as a finite union of basic semi-Pfaffian sets.
In fact, basic sets can be defined using any functions definable in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and it is clear that any finite union of sets defined by conjunctions of strict or non-strict inequalities is the finite union of basic sets. The representation of \(Z\) as the union of hypersurfaces containing basic sets is also possible, and the argument that open balls cannot be contained in a set of smaller dimension is geometric and still holds. Thus, the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:section-split} can be reproduced almost identically, too.

Note that it is not currently clear how this result can be implemented since in the algorithm for cylindrical decomposition by \citet{gv01} the oracle is needed to decide whether a sub-Pfaffian set is empty or not.

\hypertarget{sec:novel-frontier-fw}{%
\subsection{Further Wrok}\label{sec:novel-frontier-fw}}

The complexity upper bound of the algorithm from Theorem \ref{thm:main} is significantly worse than the bound
for classical CAD algorithm due to \citet{collins1975} (and \citet{wuthrich1976}).
This is caused by the parameter of its recursive loop: the index of a cylindrical cell, which is exponential in the ambient dimension.
It is difficult to see another parameter that could make the recursion significantly shorter. Thus, if any progress is to be made towards a better asymptotic complexity, the method used may need to be based on a completely different ideas.
On the other hand, there is a lower bound on complexity of the classical CAD algorithm due to \citet{davenportHeintz1988}. However, it is not yet known whether the lower bound for CAD with frontier condition is greater than that of the classical CAD.
Another strand of research could be to explore this question, possibly by attempting to raise this lower bound for CAD with frontier condition.

Another improvement in the algorithm might come from a different subroutine for computing the frontier
of a cylindrical cell.
The subroutine from Lemma \ref{lem:frontier} works for any semialgebraic set and does not take advantage of its
cylindrical structure.
We may be able to exploit this structure by factorising the equational part of the formula
representing a cell into irreducible components, generalising a method due to \citet{lazard10}.

Finally, since some initial CAD is refined repeatedly, the classical CAD algorithm from Proposition \ref{prp:collins} could be replaced with an incremental algorithm, E.g., the algorithm presented by \citet{kremer2020}. It is not clear whether substituting the CAD algorithm will reduce the complexity bound. The set \(X_N\) is still computed at each step, using a singly exponential algorithm, and the initial CAD may need to be refined at every step and this refinement may result in the incremental algorithm backtracking all the way to the decomposition induced on \(\mathbb{R}^1\). However, this change would be very useful in practice as unnecessary CAD re-computations could be avoided, E.g., if \(\mathcal{E}_N\) is already compatible with the set \(X_N\), the algorithm in its current form will compute the refinement even though it is not needed.

This thesis makes three main contributions:

\tightlist
\item
  an implementation of a smooth stratification algorithm, based on the work of \citet{gv1995};
\item
  a concrete algorithm and implementation for constructing a CAD, monotone with respect to semialgebraic sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(\dim(V_i) \le 2\), and satisfying the frontier condition;
\item
  and a novel algorithm for constructing a CAD, satisfying the frontier condition and compatible with a semialgebraic set \(S \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) of arbitrary dimension.
\end{enumerate}

Complexity results for each of the algorithms are presented, and the first two algorithms have been implemented in C, on top of \texttt{saclib}.

\hypertarget{smooth-stratification-of-a-semialgebraic-set}{%
\subsection{Smooth stratification of a semialgebraic set}\label{smooth-stratification-of-a-semialgebraic-set}}

Chapter \ref{sec:smooth-strat} presents the algorithm from \citet{gv1995}, Theorem 1 which computes a smooth stratification of a semi-Pfaffian set \(X \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) and then specialises it to the semialgebraic case, where the Oracle is not required, since it is always possible to check whether a semialgebraic set is empty. The main contribution of this section is a concrete algorithm and its implementation on top of \texttt{saclib}, which uses \texttt{QEPCAD-B} to determine whether candidate strata are empty. The implementation also ensures that each strata is defined ``nicely'', i.e., every stratum of codimension \(k\) is defined by exactly \(k\) polynomial equations and, possibly, some inequalities.
Complexity bounds, based on \citet{gv1995} and a singly exponential algorithm for deciding emptiness due to \citet{bpr98} are presented, including the bound on the number of strata, along with the maximum degree and number of polynomials required to define each stratum.

\citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 gives a constructive proof that there exists a CAD, monotone with respect to a collection of bounded definable sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), each of which has dimension at most \(2\), and satisfying the frontier condition. The main contribution of Chapters \ref{sec:quasi-affine}, \ref{sec:monotone-cells} and \ref{sec:frontier} is the design and implementation of an algorithm, based on \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20, for constructing such a CAD. Following the construction due to \citet{bgv15}, the algorithm proceeds in three steps.

First, a CAD, compatible with each of \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) and such that each cell \(C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\) is the graph of a quasi-affine map, following \citet{bgv15} Lemma 3.19, is constructed. This lemma first instructs us to consider \(W\), the smooth \(2\)-dimensional locus of \(V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\).
This can be done by applying the smooth stratification algorithm, as presented in Section \ref{sec:smooth-strat}, and collecting the strata of codimension \(n-2\).
It was then observed that, according to \citet{mccallum1998} Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, if McCallum's projection operator is used and there is only a finite number of blow-up points, smooth cells are obtained automatically.
\citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19 then tells us to construct a CAD which is compatible with all \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\) and the critical points of the projections of \(W\) onto one- and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces. This can be done by ensuring that the CAD has constant sign on all polynomials defining the sets \(V_1,\ldots,V_k\), along with some additional polynomials which arise from computing the determinants of Jacobi matrices defining either the (smooth) \(2\)-dimensional cells, or \(2\)-dimensional strata.
This completes the construction described in \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.19. Pseudo-code is presented and a complexity bound of \(\left(s (d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\), which is slightly worse than classical CAD, is obtained.

Next, Chapter \ref{sec:monotone-cells} describes how some simple refinements of the quasi-affine CAD can be performed such that each cell \(C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k\) is monotone. These refinements, described in \citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.11, are of the kind \(\{ x_1 = c \}, \{ x_1 > c \}, \{ x_1 < c \}\), where \(c \in \mathbb{R}\). Since the real roots of polynomials are always algebraic numbers, in the semialgebraic case, \(c\) is always an element of \(\mathbb{A}\). These refinements are easy to perform, as they simply split \((1)\)-cells, and, by \citet{bgv15} Lemma 3.11, this type of refinement preserves the cylindrical structure along with existing monotone cells.
\citet{bgv15}, Lemma 3.18, defines these refinement points as those which ensure that the top and bottom of every \(2\)-dimensional cell contained in \(V_1\cup \ldots V_k\) is the graph of a continuous, definable, monotone map. The main contribution of this Chapter is the application of Lagrange Multipliers to find these refinement points. This process relies on computing determinants of square matrices of polynomials and finding the first coordinate of their real root -- straightforward tools which are readily available in almost every computer algebra system.
Again, pseudo-code is presented and a complexity result, which is the same as that presented in Chapter \ref{sec:quasi-affine}, is obtained.

Finally, Chapter \ref{sec:frontier} explains how to refine the CAD such that it satisfies the frontier condition. The
first approach is a direct translation of the last part of \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20. I.e., the frontiers of \(2\)-dimensional
cells are computed and then partitioned into points and monotone curve intervals. The latter part of this construction,
partitioning a one-dimensional curve into monotone pieces -- is straightforward, as it has already been done when constructing monotone cells in the previous chapter.
However, the task of computing the frontier of a semialgebraic set is not as easy. Lemma \ref{lem:frontier} describes how to do this using quantifier elimination, and asserts that it has complexity singly exponential in the number of variables. However, the algorithm presented in \citep[Algorithm 14.21]{bpr2006} is theoretical in nature and, in practice, we would have to resort to doubly exponential CAD to solve the QE problem.
Endeavouring to avoid this, we turned to \citet{lazard10}, who presents an algorithm for computing a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with frontier condition. This algorithm relies on a CAD, containing only topologically regular cells, and having constant sign on a set of polynomials to be given. Since this has already been done (in Chapters \ref{sec:quasi-affine} and \ref{sec:monotone-cells}), Lazard's algorithm can be applied directly in dimension \(3\). Furthermore, if \(2\)-dimensional cells are contained in a sub-CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) above a \(0\)-dimensional cell, hen Lazard's algorithm can, again, be applied directly to the sub-CAD.
The main contribution of Chapter \ref{sec:frontier} is the observation that a similar situation to that described by Lazard exists in the special case of \(2\)-dimensional cells in a CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and the suggestion of an extension of Lazard's method to this situation.
This is the approach taken in the implementation, since it is more tractable than computing the frontier of every cell.
Pseudo-code for the extension of Lazard's algorithm and a complexity analysis for both Gabrielov and Vorobjov's approach and Lazard's approach is performed. The complexity, for both approaches, is \(\left(s (d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\), which is the overall complexity of constructing the CAD with the properties from \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20.

Thus, a concrete description of an algorithm to construct the cylindrical decomposition, in the semialgebraic case, described in \citet{bgv15}, Theorem 3.20 is given, which has complexity only slightly worse than classical CAD.
Chapter \ref{sec:implementation-and-testing} is concerned with the implementation details of the this algorithm, along with presenting some test cases which give an exposition of its three stages: quasi-affine, monotone and frontier condition.

The final contribution is an algorithm, having ELEMENTARY complexity, for constructing a CAD, compatible with a semialgebraic set of arbitrary dimension and satisfying the frontier condition.
This algorithm removes the restriction imposed by \citet{jhd20}, as blow-ups are permitted, and does not require the rotation of coordinates proposed by \citet{pianomovers1983}.
It was not clear how this could be achieved using the usual induction -- on the ambient dimension -- so a novel approach was needed. The algorithm relies on a recursion on the lexicographical order of cell index \((i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{0,1\}^n\). A mathematical description, proof of correctness, complexity analysis and pseudo-code are presented for this algorithm, which has complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables.
This work was presented in extended abstract form at CASC 2023 and is currently under review for publication in the Journal of Symbolic Computation.
This algorithm has not yet been implemented due to time constraints, but it is clear from the pseudo-code that it could be done using the tools we have been using throughout this thesis.

\hypertarget{further-work}{%
\section{Further Work}\label{further-work}}

Another fundamental construction in real algebraic geometry is triangulation -- which partitions a set into a collection of simplices (a simplicial complex).
The main result of \citet{bgv15} relates to definable monotone families.
A family \(\{ S_\delta \}_{\delta >0}\) is called monotone if sets \(S_\delta\) are monotone
increasing as \(\delta \to 0\), i.e., \(S_\delta \subset S_\eta\) for all sufficiently small \(\delta > \eta >0\).
It is often useful to approximate definable sets \(K \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) by definable monotone families \(S_{\delta}\). However, when blow-up points are present, these families can exibit a complex behaviour.
\citet{bgv15} prove that there exists a triangulation of every definable set \(K \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), having dimension at most two, such that in each \(2\)-simplex, the family belongs to one of five types, corresponding to one of five possible lexicographically monotone Boolean functions in two variables.
The proof of the classification in \citet{bgv15} is non-constructive.
A natural progression of this project would be to design and implement an efficient
algorithm computing a triangulation for the input \((K, \{ S_\delta \})\).
An essential step in the computation of this triangulation is the construction of a CAD with monotone cells and satisfying the frontier condition. Furthermore, a linear change of coordinates, as suggested by, e.g., \citet{pianomovers1983}, is not allowed. Therefore, the monotone CAD algorithm developed in this thesis will be needed as a subroutine for this algorithm.

It is conjectured that this classification can be extended to \(n\)-dimensional sets \(K\).
Another direction of research would be to prove this conjecture by generalising the results of \citet{bgv15}, and design an algorithm for computing such a triangulation in the case of sets with arbitrary dimension.
The first step would be to generalise the monotone CAD algorithm to sets with higher dimension.
It is not currently clear how this can be done, but one might want to start with sets of dimension \(3\).
In \citet{bgvII} an algorithm-like procedure was proposed for constructing a decomposition of a 3-dimensional \(K\)
into topologically regular cylindrical cells which may not form an overall cylindrical decomposition, as cells may be cylindrical with respect to different orderings of variables.
The first step in solving this problem may be to implement this procedure or, possibly, strengthen it to obtain a decomposition which is cylindrical with respect to the given coordinate ordering.
The results in Section \ref{sec:novel-frontier} make some strides towards the generalisation, allowing us to obtain the frontier condition in CADs compatible with sets of any dimension.

In addition, there are open questions, both theoretical and practical, relating to the novel algorithm for obtaining the frontier condition, presented in Section \ref{sec:novel-frontier}. For example, one might try to tighten the triply exponential complexity bound, by exploring whether it could be lowered, or by proving that the bound on CAD with frontier condition is higher than the doubly exponential bound obtained by \citet{davenportHeintz1988}. Practically speaking, the algorithm presented in Section \ref{sec:novel-frontier} should be implemented, following the suggestions made in Section \ref{sec:novel-frontier-fw}, and tested with some examples of small dimension.

Finally, the implementation of the monotone CAD algorithm is a proof of concept and, as such, there is plenty of room for improvement where efficiency is concerned. For example, in order to compute the \(x_1\)-coordinates of the solutions to a system of multivariate polynomial equations. CAD projection is used. It is well-known that a doubly exponential number of polynomials may result. It may be more efficient to use other tools, e.g., Groebner bases, to compute these \(x_1\)-coordinates.

Note that two refinement polynomials are produced, but only one refinement point. \texttt{M\_1\_4} lies outside of \(-1 < x < 1\), so it is ignored.

Example \ref{exm:qanm-4-rat}, which follows, demonstrates what happens on sub-CADs above 0-dimensional cells.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:qanm-4-rat}{}\label{exm:qanm-4-rat}Let \(n = 4\) and consider the semialgebraic set defined by the QFF
\[
F := ( ( 4 w = 7 \lor w^2 = 36 ) \land x > 0 \land x < 1 \land y > 0 \land x + y < 1 \land z = w x^2 + y^2 ).
\]
It has three connected components, \(C_1\), \(C_2\) and \(C_3\), each of which is a cylindrical section cell in a sub-CAD of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) above a \(0\)-dimensional cell (\(\mathbf{b}_1\), \(\mathbf{b}_2\), \(\mathbf{b}_3\) respectively).
\begin{align}
\mathbf{b}_1 &= 7/4, &C_1 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x > 0 ,x < 1 ,y > 0 ,x + y < 1 ,z = 7/4 x^2 + y^2 \}.\\
\mathbf{b}_2 &= -6, &C_3 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x > 0 ,x < 1 ,y > 0 ,x + y < 1 ,z = -6 x^2 + y^2 \}.\\
\mathbf{b}_3 &= 6, &C_3 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x > 0 ,x < 1 ,y > 0 ,x + y < 1 ,z = 6 x^2 + y^2 \}.
\end{align}

\(C_2\) is already monotone. This can be seen by examining the projections of its top and bottom onto \({\operatorname{span} \{x,z\}}\):
\begin{align}
C_{2,B} &= \{ -1 < x < 1, z = -6x^2 \},\\
C_{2,T} &= \{ -1 < x < 1, z = -5x - 2x + 1 \}.
\end{align}

\(C_1\) and \(C_3\) are of the same kind as the cell presented in Example \ref{exm:qanm} and require refinement.

3D multi: multi-3.txt. many unnecesary refinements computed resulting from quasi-affine. had to use +N5000000

4D multi: it's similar, but requiring algebraic refinements. this required +N50000000 for saclib and look at how many cells it produced!
we should probably associate the quasi polynomials with the true cell so that we don't make a truly tsign-invariant CAD
