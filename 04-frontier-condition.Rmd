# Frontier Condition {#sec:frontier}

Suppose we have a CAD $\cal D'$ monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2, 1 \le i \le k$.
The algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm) produces such a CAD, which is also sign-invariant on a set of
polynomials $\mathbf{F} \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. It is clear that $\mathbf{F}$ should contain the polynomials in
defining formulas for sets $V_i$, along with some additional polynomials which ensure that each cell $C \subset V_1 \cup
\ldots \cup V_k$ is monotone.
In this section, we describe how to refine $\mathcal{D'}$ in order that it satisfies the frontier condition. A refinement, $\mathcal{D''}$ of $\mathcal{D'}$ satisfies the frontier condition if $\fr{C}$ is a union of cells of $\mathcal{D''}$, for each cell $C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$ of $\mathcal{D''}$ (Definition \@ref(def:frontier-condition)).

We first present a motivating example due to @jhd20.

::: { .example #whitney-jhd }
[@jhd20, Example 2.1]

Let $f := y^2 - x^2 z$ and observe that $f(0,0,z) = 0, z \in \R$, i.e., $f$ "blows up" above the origin. Let $\Delta := \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid 0 < x < 1, -x < y < x \} \subset \R^2$ and let
$$
W := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \mid (x,y) \in \Delta, f(x,y,z) = 0 \}.
$$
Consider $\fr{W}$, which can be expressed as the disjoint union of four basic semialgebraic sets:
\begin{align}
\fr{W} =&\ \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, y = x, z = 1 \} \\
\cup&\ \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \mid 0 < x < 1, y = -x, z = 1 \} \\
\cup&\ \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \mid x = 1, -1 < y < 1, z = y^2 \} \\
\cup&\ \{ (0,0,z) \in \R^3 \mid 0 \le z \le 1 \}.
(\#eq:jhd-whitney-blow-up)
\end{align}
Due to the blow-up point above the origin, $\fr{W}$ contains the subset $B := \{ (0,0,z) \in \R^3 \mid 0 \le z \le 1 \}$ (from Equation \@ref(eq:jhd-whitney-blow-up)).

A CAD having constant sign on the polynomials
$$
\{ x, x - 1, x + y, x - y, y^2 - x^2 z \}
$$ defining $W$ will not contain the blow-up subset $B$, because two additional polynomials, $z$ and $z-1$, are needed to define it.
:::

It is clear from Example \@ref(exm:whitney-jhd) that a sign-invariant CAD may not always be sufficient to construct a CAD with frontier condition. @pianomovers1983 proved that it is always possible to construct a sign-invariant CAD which satisfies the frontier condition if a linear rotation of coordinates is permitted. @jhd20 also proved that a sign-invariant CAD will always satisfy the frontier condition if polynomials containing blow-up points are not allowed. In the following sections, we discuss what to do when a rotation of coordinates is not permitted and when blow-up points may be present.

Note that $W$, from Example \@ref(exm:whitney-jhd), is a $(1,1,0)$-cell, but it is not monotone. In fact, $W$ is not even the graph of a quasi-affine map, since $\projops{x,z}(W)$ is two-dimensional, but the projection map $\projops{x,z}\vert_W$ is not injective. The blow-up subset $B$, contained in $\fr{W}$ means that $W$ is not a topologically regular cell, since $\fr(W)$ is not homeomorphic to a circle.
In the procedures described in the following sections, due to @bgv15 and @lazard10, the cells on which the frontier condition is to be satisfied must be topologically regular cells.

## Construction of a CAD with frontier condition due to Basu, Gabrielov and Vorobjov { #sec:frontier-bgv }

Given the monotone CAD $\mathcal{D'}$ computed in the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm), our final step, according to [@bgv15, Theorem 3.20] is to compute a refinement $\mathcal{D''}$ of $\mathcal{D'}$ such that the frontier $\fr{C} = \cl{C} \setminus C$ of every cell $C \subset V = V_1\cup \ldots, \cup V_k$ is a union of cells of $\cal D''$.

The construction from @bgv15, Theorem 3.20 proceeds as follows. For each $2$-dimensional cell $C \subset V$, consider the semialgebraic set $\fr{C}$. Since $C$ is monotone, we can assume that $\fr{C}$ is homeomorphic to a circle. Construct a partition $\cal U$ of $\fr{C}$ into monotone one-dimensional curves and points, such that $\cal U$ is compatible with all one-dimensional cells of $\cal D'$.
Let $\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_n)$ be one of the one-dimensional components of $\cal U$. If $c_1$ is not a $0$-dimensional cell of the decomposition induced by $\cal D'$ on $\R^1$, then perform a refinement of the kind $x_1 < c_1, x_1 = c_1, x_1 > c_1$. Recall that these refinements, according to [@bgv15, Lemma 3.11], preserve the cylindrical structure and monotone cells. Otherwise, $c_1$ is a $0$-cell and we apply the same argument to the sub-CAD of $\cal D'$ above $c_1$.

Now let $T \in {\cal U}$ be one of the one-dimensional components. If $T$ is not an existing 1-dimensional cell of $\cal D'$, then it is a subset of a 2-dimensional cell $Z$ of $\cal D'$. In fact, it divides $Z$ into two cells $Z \setminus T$, both of which, according to [@bgv13, Theorem 11], are 2-dimensional monotone cylindrical cells. Hence, replacing $Z$ by $T$ and the two monotone connected components of $Z \setminus T$ makes $Z$ compatible with $\fr{C}$, while the refinement of $Z$ consists of only monotone cells.

Repeating this process for each $0$- and $1$-dimensional component of $\cal U$, we obtain a refinement of $\cal D'$ compatible with $\fr{C}$.
This completes the construction of a cylindrical decomposition $\mathcal{D''}$ satisfying the frontier condition and monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set of dimension at most two $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.

The most computationally difficult part of implementing this construction is computing $\fr{C}$.

::: {.lemma #frontier}
Let $S \subset \R^n$ be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula $F$
containing $s$ different polynomials in $\R [x_1, \ldots ,x_n]$ having maximum degree $d$.
There is an algorithm, taking $F$ as input, which represents the semialgebraic set $\fr{ S }$ by a quantifier-free Boolean formula $F'$ with complexity
$$(sd)^{O(n^2)}.
$$
This is also an upper bound on the number of polynomials in $F'$ and their degrees.
:::

Lemma \@ref(lem:frontier) is proved and discussed in more detail in Section \@ref(sec:novel-frontier-fr).
The "obvious" way of computing the frontier involves solving a quantifier elimination problem with two quantifier alternations. Using an efficient algorithm, e.g., [@bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21], this procedure has complexity singly exponential in the number of variables. $\partial C$ is represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula $F$.

Once $\fr(C)$ has been computed, we first construct the family $\cal U$ of one-dimensional curve intervals $T$ and the points between them $\mathbf{c}$. By Lemma \@ref(lem:one-dim-qa-is-monotone), one-dimensional quasi-affine cells are always monotone. Thus, we may apply the method described in Section \@ref(sec:quasi-affine) to obtain Jacobi matrices whose determinants are zero at the critical points of projections onto one and two-dimensional coordinate subspaces.
If CAD with the McCallum projection operator is used to solve the QE problem, then each smooth 1-dimensional cell $D$ in $\fr{C}$ will be defined by $n-1$ polynomials. We refine $\fr{C}$ to be compatible with the critical points of $\projops{x_i}(D), 1\le i \le n$ defined by $\det(J_{\{1,\ldots,n\}\setminus \{i\}}) = 0$.

A further refinement of each one-dimensional component $T$ of $\cal U$ to be compatible with existing cells of $\cal D'$ may also be required.
For each one-dimensional component $T \in {\cal U}$ and each one-dimensional cell $D$ of $\cal D'$, consider $E := T \cap D$ such that $E \ne \emptyset$.
If $E \subset D$, then $T$ should be split into one-dimensional components $E$ and $\int(T \setminus E)$ and the zero-dimensional endpoints of $E$. This makes $\cal U$ compatible with all cells of the CAD $\cal D'$.

Consider each $T \in {\cal U}$ which is a subset of a 2-dimensional cell $Z$. The refinement can be performed exactly as described by @bgv15, Theorem 3.20. I.e., partition $Z$ into $Z_1 \cup T \cup Z_2$ where $Z_{1,B}=Z_B$ and $Z_{1,T} = T$ and $Z_{1,B}=Z_T$ and $Z_{1,T} = Z_T$.

Now consider the zero-dimensional components $\mathbf{c} = (c_1,\ldots,c_n)$ of $\cal U$. Refinements of $\cal D$ to be compatible with $\mathbf{c}$ again proceed as described by @bgv15. I.e., Consider $C' := \projop{k}(C)$ such that $C'$ is zero-dimensional and equal to $(c_1,\ldots,c_k)$, but $\projop{k+1}(C)$ is one-dimensional. Perform a refinement of the sub-cad above $(c_1,\ldots,c_k)$ by intersecting it with $\{ x_k < c_k \}, \{ x_k = c_k \}, \{ x_k > c_k \}$ -- the refinements defined in @bgv15, Lemma 3.11. Repeat until $(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$ is a cell in the refinement.

Let $\cal D''$ be the refinement of $\cal D'$, compatible with $\fr{C}$ for all 2-dimensional cells $C$ of $\cal D'$. This CAD is compatible with, and monotone with respect to all $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, and the frontier of each cell $C \subset V_1\cup \ldots V_k$ of $\cal D''$ is the union of some other cells of $\cal D''$ of smaller dimension.
$\cal D''$ satisfies the frontier condition, so the construction is complete.

We have proved that the following algorithm exists, and will discuss its complexity later.

::: { .theorem #lazard-rn }
Let $\mathbf{F} \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a set of $s$ polynomials with maximum degree $d$.
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n$, compatible with some bounded definable semialgebraic sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, which $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ and such that each cell $C \subset V_i$ is monotone.

Then there is an algorithm, taking $\mathcal{D}$ as input, which produces a refinement $\mathcal{D'}$ of $\mathcal{D}$ such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ of $\mathcal{D'}$ satisfies the frontier condition.
This algorithm has complexity
$$
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^{n}},
$$
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

## Lazard's method for dimension not greater than 3 { #sec:lazard-3 }

The method described in Section \@ref(sec:frontier-bgv) is relatively straightforward as it relies on techniques we have used before (obtaining quasi-affine subsets and performing refinements). However, we may want to find an alternative method, so as to avoid the QE required to compute the frontiers of $2$-dimensional cylindrical cells.
In the following section, we will explore an alternative method to obtain the frontier condition, based on an algebraic construction described by @lazard10.

@lazard10 presents an algorithm for constructing an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant cylindrical algebraic decomposition of $\R^n, n\le 3$ such that every cell is a topologically  regular cell and the frontier condition is satisfied.
Lazard refers to a decomposition having these properties as a "strong" decomposition.

::: {.definition #laz-properties }
[@lazard10, Definition 2.7]

1. A cylindrical cell $C$ is boundary smooth if the intersection with $C$ of every small open ball centred on the boundary of $C$ is connected
2. A $k$-dimensional cylindrical cell is well-bordered if $\fr{C}$ is the closure of some $k-1$-dimensional cylindrical cells.
3. A cylindrical cell $C$ is boundary coherent if $\fr{C}$ is a union of cells.
:::

::: {.remark}
[@lazard10, Definition 2.7]

These properties can be extended from cells to the whole CAD. I.e., a CAD $\mathcal{D}$ is called well-bordered (resp. boundary coherent, boundary smooth) if every cell in $\mathcal{D}$ is well-bordered (resp. boundary coherent, boundary smooth).
:::

::: {.remark}
If a cylindrical cell satisfies Property 2 of Definition \@ref(def:laz-properties) (boundary smooth) then it is a topologically regular cell.

Property 3 of Definition \@ref(def:laz-properties) (boundary coherent) is the frontier condition (see Definition \@ref(def:frontier-condition)).
@jhd20 call this property closure finiteness.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@lazard10, Definition 2.7]

A CAD is called "strong" if every cell is boundary smooth, well-bordered and boundary coherent.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@lazard10, Definition 4.1]

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n$ and $\mathcal{D'}$ be the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^{n-1}$. A cell $C'$ of $\mathcal{D'}$ is called "bad" if there is a polynomial $f \in \mathbf{F} \subset \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $f$ is primitive and has positive degree in $x_n$ and $f(\mathbf{x})$, for all $\mathbf{x} \in C'$ vanishes over an open interval. Every point $\mathbf{x}$ in the bad cell $C'$ is a blow-up point of the polynomial $f$ (see Definition \@ref(def:blow-up-point)).
:::

According to @lazard10, Corollary 4.7, in dimension $\le 2$, there is nothing to do as Collins' algorithm already produces these "strong" decompositions.
For a cylindrical decomposition of $\R^3$, the process proceeds in three steps:

1. Obtain well-bordered cells
2. Obtain boundary smooth cells
3. "Lift above bad points" to satisfy the frontier condition.

First, we must ensure that every cell is well-bordered. The following result shows that this is already the case for sign-invariant decompositions of $\R^3$.

::: {.proposition #lazard-5-4}
[@lazard10, Corollary 5.4]

Every $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n, n \le 3$ is well-bordered.
:::

Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-4) follows from @lazard10, Lemma 5.1 and Theorem 5.3.
The former asserts that every $0$- and $1$-dimensional cell in a CAD of arbitrary dimension is well-bordered.
The latter asserts that any cell in an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^3$, such that the decomposition $\mathcal{D}'$ induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^2$ is strong, is well-bordered.
Note that $\mathcal{D}'$ is a $\projop{2}(\mathbf{F})$-invariant CAD of $\R^2$ and is always strong by @lazard10, Corollary 4.7.
@lazard10, Proposition 5.2 depends on the following result.

::: {.proposition #lazard-5-2}
[@lazard10, Proposition 5,2]

Let $\cal D$ be a CAD of $\R^n$ and $\cal D'$ the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{n-1}$. Let $C$ be a cell of $\cal D$ and $C' := \projop{n-1} (C)$ such that $C'$ is well-bordered.
If $p \in \fr{C'}$, then $I := (p \times \R) \cap \fr{C}$ is connected.
$I$ is therefore a point or a closed segment, either bounded or unbounded.
Furthermore, if $C$ is a sector cell, then the set of points of $I$ which do not belong to the boundaries of the section cells delineating $C$ is either empty or an open interval.
:::

@lazard10, Theorem 5.12 describes how to pass from a well-bordered, $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^3$ to one in which every cell is boundary smooth. This is done by refining $\mathcal{D}$ such that it has constant sign on some new polynomials. This refinement contains only well-bordered, topologically regular cells.
The construction of a CAD with monotone cells described in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-cells) also satisfies these properties, if we limit ourselves to $n\le3$. Indeed, the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:quasiaffine-algorithm) returns a CAD with constant sign on $\mathbf{F'}$, the set of input polynomials and the additional polynomials added to ensure that every cell is smooth and the graph of a quasi-affine map. Hence, every cell in this CAD is well-bordered. The algorithm for obtaining monotone cells, described in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm) requires us to compute refinements of the kind $\{ x_1 < c \}, \{ x_1 = c \}, \{ x_1 > c \}$ of a $(1)$-cell $C'$ in the sub-decomposition above a 0-dimensional cell.
This refinement is also applied to every cell $C$ in this sub-decomposition such that $C' := \projop{1}(C)$. Thus, the refined CAD is sign invariant on $\mathbf{F'}$ and the cells $C$ projecting on $C'$ are sign-invariant with respect to polynomials $x_1 - c$, defining each refinement point $c$.
Cells which were not refined are either already monotone or lie outside of the input sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.
As a result, we are able to apply Lazard's method for lifting with bad points to the CAD produced by the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm).

@lazard10, Section 5.3 describes how to pass from an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^3$ such that every cell is well-bordered and boundary smooth to one satisfying the frontier condition.
By @lazard10, Theorem 4.4, a cell $C$ already satisfies the frontier condition if no points in its frontier project on a bad cell (see also @jhd20).
Thus, only cells which fail to satisfy this property need to be considered. By @lazard10, Lemma 4.3, in $\R^3$, if a bad cell exists, then it has dimension $0$.

::: { .proposition #only-bad-zero-cells }
[@lazard10, Lemma 4.3]

A sign-invariant CAD of $\R^2$ contains no bad cells.

For an $\mathbf{F} \subset \Q[x_1,x_2,x_3]$-invariant CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^3$, if the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^2$ contains a bad cell, then it is a $(0,0)$-cell.
:::

This follows from the fact that, in $\R^n$, a blow-up point of a polynomial in $\Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ in $\R^{n-1}$ has codimension at least two (see Remark aftor Definition \@ref(def:blow-up-point)).

::: { .proposition #no-blow-up }
[@lazard10, Theorem 4.4]

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n$ and $C$ be a cell of $\mathcal{D}$ with $C' := \proj_{\R^{n-1}}(C)$. If the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{n-1}$ is strong and none of $C'$ and any cell $D'$ such that $D' \cap \fr{C'} \ne \emptyset$ is bad, $C$ is well-bordered, boundary smooth and $\fr{C}$ is a union of some cells of $\mathcal{D}$.
:::

::: {.proof}
This result follows from the following fact about roots of multivariate polynomials: given a polynomial $f  \in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]$, i.e., considered as a univariate polynomial with polynomial coefficients, its complex roots depend continuously on the parameters in the region of the parameter space where the polynomial does not vanish identically. In fact, this is only true in the projective closure of $\mathbb{C}$ as some roots may pass through the point at infinity if the leading coefficient is zero.

First suppose that $C$ is a section cell. I.e., it is a root of some polynomial $f$ and $\fr{C}$ is defined as the limit of this root over the boundary of $C'$. Thus $\projop{n-1}$ is a continuous, injective map from $\fr{C}$ to $\fr{C'}$. This follows from the assumption that the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{n-1}$ is strong and that if the root defining the section $C$ is infinite over some cell $C'' \subset \fr{C'}$, then it is also infinite over $\fr{C''}$.

Now suppose that $C$ is a sector cell. If nonempty, the top $C_T$ and bottom $C_B$ of $C$ are section cells. We complete the proof by describing $W := \fr{C} \setminus (C_T \cup C_B)$.
We will only consider the case where $C \cap \{ \mathbf{x} \times \R \}$ is an open interval bounded from below by a point in $C_B$ and above by a point in $C_T$.

Let $\dim(C) = d + 1$. $\fr{C}$ consists of

- the cells in $\fr{C_B}$ and $\fr{C_T}$, which have dimension $< d$ and are contained in $\fr{C'} \times \R$,
- the intervals (which may be empty) bounded by the points in $\fr{C_B}$ and $\fr{C_T}$, contained in $C' \times \R$. Since $C_B$ and $C_T$ are section cells, they are roots of polynomials $f$ and $g$ and, if finite, the points in $\fr{C_B}$ and $\fr{C_T}$ are also roots of $f$ and $g$ (respectively). Therefore, these intervals are contained in some cells of $\cal D$. More precisely, the cells with dimension $d$ contained in $\fr{C'} \times \R$ are exactly those lying over a cell $C'' \subset \fr{C'}$ with dimension $d-1$.

A cell of dimension $< d$ either belongs to $\fr{C_B}$ or $\fr{C_T}$, or is a sector over a cell $D \subset \fr{C'}$ having dimension less than $d-1$.
As $C'$ is well-bordered, $D$ belongs to the boundary of some cell $E \subset \fr{C'}$ having dimension $d-1$.
Thus, the sector above $D$ is contained in the boundary of the sector above $E$, which has dimension $d$

This proves that, if the decomposition induced by $D$ on $\R^{n-1}$ is strong, then $C$ is well-bordered and also satisfies the frontier condition. In addition, this proves that $C$ is a topologically regular cell as $C$ and $\fr{C}$ are either homeomorphic to $C'$ and $\fr{C'}$, if $C$ is a sector cell, or to an open cylinder, either bounded or unbounded, and its boundary. It is clear that an open cylinder contained in $C' \times \R$, where $C'$ is topologically regular, is also topologically regular.

The other cases are deduced by omitting the cells defined from $C_B$ and $C_T$ as appropriate.

::: {.proof}
By the proof of @lazard10, Theorem 4.4, $D$ will always be a $(0,0,1)$-cell in the cylinder above a bad cell $D'$.

Consider each case for $C$ by cell index.

- $(1,1,1)$-cell: since $C$ is well-bordered, its boundary is the closure of some 2-dimensional cells of $\cal D$ and $B$ is contained in the union of the boundaries of the 2-cells. Thus, case 2 applies and we can choose an appropriate 2-dimensional cell in $\fr{C}$ for $E$.

- $(1,0,1)$- or $(0,1,1)$-cell, we write $(i,j,1)$-cell where $i+j=1$: observe that $C$ (if bounded) is delineated by some $(i,j,0)$-cells (one-dimensional curve intervals). Take $B$ to be the one-dimensional interval delineated by the endpoints of these cells. Since $B \neq C$, at least one of these endpoints is not a $(0,0,0)$-cell of $\cal D$. Case 2 applies, taking as $E$ the delineating $(i,j,0)$-cell.

- $(1,0,0)$- or $(0,1,0)$-cells: consider the previous case, letting $C = E$.

- $(1,1,0)$-cell: these are necessarily the root of a polynomial $f \in \Q[x_1,x_2,x_3]$ which vanishes identically on $D'$, a $(0,0)$ cell in the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^2$.
Let $V_r$ be a small neighbourhood (with radius $r > 0$) centred around $D'$ and consider $V_r'$, the cylinder above the boundary of $V_r$. Since $C$ is a monotone cell, the maximum and minimum values of $x_3$ in this intersection are reached on the boundary of $C$, for sufficiently small $r$. The limits, as $r$ tends to $0$, of this maximum and minimum clearly belong to the boundary of $B$, if these limits do not tend to infinity. Note that both the maximum and minimum cannot be infinite, since this would imply that either $B$ is empty, or coincides with $D$. Therefore, the non-infinite limits are the endpoints of some $1$-dimensional cell belonging to the boundary of $C$. Case 2 applies, taking $E$ to be this $1$-dimensional cell.

- $(0,0,1)$- or $(0,0,0)$-cells: do not satisfy the hypothesis, there is nothing to do.

The following result shows how $(0,0,1)$-cells which project on a bad point can be refined to obtain the frontier condition.

Let $g\in \Q[x_1,x_2]$ be an irreducible polynomial having $\mathbf{p}$ as a root.
The limits of the common roots of $f$ and $g$ as $(x_1, x_2) \to \mathbf{p}, (x_1, x_2) \ne \mathbf{p}$ may be computed as solutions of a zero-dimensional
polynomial system.
:::

::: {.proof}
Since $f$ is irreducible, it has at least two coefficients, $g_i,g_j \in \Q[x_1,x_2]$, whose GCD is a constant.
Therefore, any ideal generated by these coefficients has dimension zero. Any ideal containing these coefficients also contains another element, $h$, which is not a multiple of $g$.

The saturation by $h$ of the ideal $\langle f,g \rangle$ is defined as the ideal
$$
S := \langle f, g, 1 - zh \rangle \cap \Q[x_1,x_2,x_3].
$$
The irreducible components of the zero set of $S$ are those of the zero set of $\langle f,g \rangle$ at which $h$ is not identically zero. It follows that the vertical line $\{ x_1 = p_1, x_2 = p_2 \}$ which is part of the zero set of $f$ ,$g$ and $h$, is not contained in the zero set of $S$. Meanwhile, the zero set of $S$ contains the limit points we are interested in finding.

Therefore, the ideal generated by $S$ and the coefficients $g_0,\ldots,g_d$ of $f$ is zero-dimensional and the limits of $\{ f=0,g=0 \}$ as $(x_1,x_2) \to \mathbf{p}$ can be computed as the zeros of $S$.

Suppose that $f \in I:J\infty$ and $a \in V(I) \setminus V(J)$. Then $fg^N \in I$ for all $g \in J$ and a suitable (large enough) $N\ge 0$. Since $a \in V(I)$, $f(a)g^N(a) = 0$ (for all $g\in J$ and large enough $N$). Since $a \not \in V(J)$, there exists $f \in J$ and $N \ge 0$ such that $g(a) \ne 0$. Hence $f(a) = 0$ for all $a \in V(I) \setminus V(J)$. We have $f \in I(V(I) \setminus V(J))$. Transitivity of $\subset$ proves the claim. Since $V$ reverses inclusion, we have $= \cl{ V(i) \setminus V(J) } = V(I(V(i) \setminus V(J))) \subset V(I:J^\infty)$.
:::

The proof of @lazard10, Proposition 5.14 begins with an irreducible polynomial $f \in \Q[x_1,x_2,x_3]$, such that there exists a $(1,1,0)$-cell $C \subset \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^3 \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}$, a point $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,p_2) \in \R^2$ such that $\mathbf{p}$ is a blow-up point of $f$, and $g \in \Q[x_1,x_2]$ such that $g(\mathbf{p}) = 0$.
Consider the variety $V(\langle f \rangle + \langle g \rangle ) = V(f) \cap V(g)$, which contains some of the one-dimensional cells which form part of $\fr{C}$ and the blow-up subset $B \subset \mathbf{p} \times \R$.
The saturation by $h$ of $I$,
$$
S := \langle f, g, 1 - zh \rangle \cap \Q[x_1,x_2,x_3]
$$
is constructed.
By Proposition \@ref(prp:cox-zariski) (@cox2013, Theorem 10),
$$
\cl{ V(\langle f,g \rangle) \setminus V(\langle h \rangle) } \subset S.
$$
Since our blow-up point $\mathbf{p}$ is $0$-dimensional, computing this Zariski closure "fills in the hole" left by removing the blow-up subset from $V(\langle f,g \rangle)$. Thus, we have the limit points of the cell $C$ as it approaches the blow-up subset $B$.
In order to find the refinement points above $\mathbf{p}$, we compute a generating set (Groebner basis) $\{ f_1,\ldots,f_k \}$ for $S$ and solve the system of equations
$$
f_1 = 0, \ldots, f_k = 0, g = 0, h = 0.
$$

Note that this procedure only works if the blow-up points have dimension zero. Otherwise, the endpoints of 1-dimensional cells in the frontier of $C$ will not be sufficient to satisfy the frontier condition.

### Lazard's algorithm for lifting with bad points in $\R^3$

Let $\cal D$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n, n \le 3$. If $n \le 2$, $\cal D$ is already strong -- well-bordered, boundary smooth and satisfies the frontier condition. In particular, by Proposition \@ref(prp:only-bad-zero-cells), the frontier condition is already satisfied since there are no bad cells in the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^2$ [@lazard10, Lemma 4.3].
Also by Proposition \@ref(prp:only-bad-zero-cells), any bad cells in the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^2$ are $0$-dimensional [@lazard10, Lemma 4.3].
Therefore, the frontier condition is satisfied everywhere except in the neighbourhoods above bad cells in the induced decomposition of $\R^2$. The following algorithm is a special method for lifting above a bad cell.

## Generalisation of Lazard's method { #sec:lazard-n }

Every $2$-dimensional cylindrical cell in a CAD of $\R^n$ is the graph of a continuous definable map $\mathbf{f} =
(f_1,\ldots,f_{n-2}) : X \to \R^{n-2}$ where $X \subset \opspan{x_i,x_j}, 1 \le i < j \le n$ is a cylindrical
$(1,1)$-cell by Proposition \@ref(prp:delete-zero-index) (@bgv13, Lemma 3.3). According to the remark following
Definition \@ref(def:blow-up-point), each component $f_j : X \to \opspan{x_j}$ of $\mathbf{f}$ is a continuous definable map at every point in $\cl{X}$ except, perhaps, for a finite set of isolated points in $\fr{X} = \cl{X} \setminus X$.
Therefore, it might be natural to ask whether the result from @lazard10 for lifting with bad points can be generalised to cylindrical decompositions of $\R^n, n > 3$ compatible with semialgebraic sets of dimension at most $2$.
Our goal is to construct a CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^n$, monotone with respect to each set $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ for all $1 \le i \le k$, such that $\cl{C}$, for each cell $C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$ of $\mathcal{D}$ is a union of some cells of $\mathcal{D}$.
Note that this method is not claimed to work for all cells of $\mathcal{D}$, in particular, those of dimension $> 2$.

In Section \@ref(sec:lazard-3), we applied Lazard's method for lifting with bad cells to CADs of $\R^3$ output by the algorithm described in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm). Lazard's algorithm required the input CAD to have two properties. First, each cell must be boundary smooth. Since each cell $C \subset V = V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k$ is constructed to be monotone, it is already topologically regular by Proposition \@ref(prp:monotone-topologically-regular) (@bgv13, Theorem 1), and is therefore already boundary smooth.
The second requirement is that every cell must be well-bordered. While Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-4) (@lazard10, Corollary 5.4) asserts that any sign-invariant CAD of $\R^3$ is well-bordered, this property cannot be extended to CADs of arbitrary dimension. Indeed, @lazard10, Example 2.11 describes a $3$-dimensional cylindrical cell in $\R^4$ which cannot be well-bordered since its frontier consists of a single half-line. This condition is necessary to get the configuration of cells described in Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-13) (@lazard10, Lemma 5.13), which is required to apply the algorithm for lifting with bad points. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this method could be generalised to cells of dimension $> 2$.

::: {.definition #strong-about-c }
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a CAD of $\R^n$ and $C$ be a cell of $\mathcal{D}$. $\mathcal{D}$ will be called strong about $C$ if $C$ is well-bordered, boundary coherent and every cell contained in $\cl{C}$ is boundary smooth.
:::

We first extend Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-4) (@lazard10, Corollary 5.4) to cells of dimension $\le 2$ in a sign-invariant CAD of $\R^n$.
This can be done by extending @lazard10, Theorem 5.3.

::: {.proposition #lazard-5-3}
[@lazard10, Theorem 5.3]

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^3$ such that the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^2$ is strong. Then every cell $C$ of $\mathcal{D}$ is well-bordered.
:::

::: {.proof}
If $\dim(C) < 2$, then $C$ is well-bordered by @lazard10, Lemma 5.1.

If $\dim(C) = 2$ and $C$ is a $(1,1,0)$-cell, then its boundary consists of some section cells which project onto one-dimensional cells in $\mathcal{D}$ and which are contained in $\fr{C'}$ and points or intervals projecting on some $0$-cells in $\fr{C'}$ by Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2).
We need to prove that these points belong to the boundary of some of the $1$-cells contained in $\fr{C}$.
Let $\mathbf{c}$ be a $0$-cell of $\mathcal{D'}$ contained in $\fr{C'}$ such that $\mathbf{c}$ is the projection of exactly one point, $\mathbf{p}$, in $\fr{C}$.
Since $C'$ is well-bordered (as $\mathcal{D'}$ is strong), there is a $1$-dimensional cell $C'_1 \subset \fr{C'}$ such that $\mathbf{c}$ is an endpoint.
If $C'_1$ is the projection of a $1$-dimensional cell contained in $\fr{C}$, we are done -- the boundary of this one-dimensional cell consists of some isolated points including $\mathbf{p}$.
$C'_1$ is not the projection of a section cell, then the limits of the sequences of points in $C$, whose projections
tend to $C'_1$, tend to $-\infty$ or $\infty$. Therefore $\mathbf{p}$ is either $-\infty$ or $\infty$, being an endpoint
of the interval $I$ associated to $C$ by Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2). This
contradicts the assumption that $\projopinv{2}(\mathbf{c}) \cap \fr{C}$ contains only $\mathbf{p}$.

If $\dim(C) = 2$ and it is a sector ($(i_1,i_2,1)$-cell), then $\fr{C}$ consists of the two $(i_1,i_2,0)$-cells $C_B$ and $C_T$ which project on $C'$ the side-wall $W = \fr{C} \setminus (C_B \cup C_T)$ which consists of points or intervals projecting on the endpoints of $C'$.
If $W$ contains an isolated point above an endpoint $\mathbf{c}$ of $C'$. Then Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2) asserts that it belongs to the boundary of a section bounding $C$ from below or above (i.e., $C_B$ or $C_T$), and we are done.

Finally, suppose that $C$ is a $(1,1,1)$-cell.
By the proof of @lazard10, Theorem 4.4, we only need to consider points in $\fr{C}$ which projects on a bad cell, say $\mathbf{b}$, of $\mathcal{D'}$.
By @lazard10, Lemma 4.3 $\dim(\mathbf{b}) = 0$.
$C_B$ and $C_T$ are $(1,1,0)$-cells, therefore we only need to consider the blow-up subsets $B := (\fr{C} \setminus (\cl{C_B} \cup \cl{C_T})) \cap (\mathbf{b} \times \R)$. By Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2) $B$ is an open interval.
As $C'$ is well-bordered, there is a $1$-dimensional cell $C'_1 \subset \fr{C'}$ such that $\mathbf{b}$ is an endpoint.
The set of points of $\fr{C}$ which project onto $C'_1$ are bounded from below and above by points of $\fr{C_B}$ and $\fr{C_T}$, thus they are $1$-dimensional section cells. The boundaries of these section cells are included in $\fr{C_B}$ and $\fr{C_T}$.
Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2) implies that these sections which project onto $C'_1$ define a (finite and non empty) $2$-dimensional sector cell which projects onto $C'_1$ whose boundary
contains $B$.

As all cases have been considered, this completes the proof.
:::

::: {.corollary #ext-lazard-5-3 }
(Corollary to @lazard10, Theorem 5.3)

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n$ and $C$ be a cell of $\mathcal{D}$ of dimension $\le 2$ such that the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^{n-1}$ is strong about $C' := \projop{n-1}(C)$. Then $C$ is well-bordered.
:::

::: {.proof}
If $\dim(C) < 2$, then $C$ is well-bordered by @lazard10, Lemma 5.1.

Since $\mathcal{D'}$ is strong about $C'$, Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2) can be applied. Suppose that $\dim(C) = 2$ and $C$ is an $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)$-cell. $C'$ is a one-dimensional $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})$-cell whose endpoints are $(0,\ldots,0)$-cells of $\mathcal{D'}$.
If $C$ is bounded from below (resp. above), then $C_B$ (resp. $C_T$) is an $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cell and the points or closed intervals associated with $C$ by Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-2) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.2) are the side-wall of $C$. Since $C_B$ and $C_T$ are one-dimensional cells of $\mathcal{D}$, they are well-bordered, and the points of $\fr{C}$ that do not belong to $\cl{C_B} \cup \cl{C_T}$ are $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-cells of $\mathcal{D}$. This proves that $C$ is not only well-bordered, but actually satisfies the frontier condition.

If $\dim(C) = 2$ and it is not a sector cell, it is an $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cell and $C'$ is a well-bordered $2$-dimensional $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})$-cell of $\mathcal{D'}$. Let us consider the cylinder $C' \times \R$, which is a union of $2$- and $3$-dimensional cells of $\mathcal{D}$.

For the $2$-dimensional $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})$-cell $C$, the same situation as in Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-3) (@lazard10, Theorem 5.3) occurs -- $\fr{C}$ consists of some one-dimensional $(j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1},0)$-cells of $\mathcal{D}$ which project on some $(j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1})$-cells of $\mathcal{D}$ which are contained in $\fr{C'}$, and some points and open intervals projecting on some $(0,\ldots,0)$-cells contained in $\fr{C}$.
We will prove in Lemma \@ref(lem:fr-lex-less) that $(j_1,\ldots,j_{n-1},0)$ is lexicographically less than $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$.
The same argument as in Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-3) (@lazard10, Theorem 5.3) can be applied to show that $C$ is well-bordered.

$(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)$-cells of $\mathcal{D}$ contained in $C' \times \R$ also have the same arrangement as $(1,1,1)$ cells in from Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-3) (@lazard10, Theorem 5.3). Being careful to take blow-up points into accont, the same argument as in the proof of Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-3) (@lazard10, Theorem 5.3) shows that these cells are also well-bordered.
:::

By Proposition \@ref(prp:no-blow-up), if no cells which intersect $\fr{C}$ project on a bad cell and the induced decomposition is strong, $C$ is well-bordered, boundary smooth and satisfies the frontier condition. Since the proof of Proposition \@ref(prp:no-blow-up) only considers cells contained in $\projop{n-1}(\cl{C}) \times \R$ this property is also true for the weaker condition that the induced decomposition is strong about $\projop{n-1}(C)$.
Thus, we need to look at what happens in the neighbourhood of bad cells (blow-up points) only.
If there is a blow-up point, then we claim that the following situation, similar to that described in Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-13) (@lazard10, Lemma 5.13), occurs.

::: {.lemma #ext-lazard-5-13 }
(Extension of Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-13) [@lazard10, Proposition 5.13])

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a sign-invarient decomposition of $\R^n$ and $C$ be a cell of $\mathcal{D}$ of dimension at most two, such that the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^{n-1}$ is strong about $\projop{n-1}(C)$. Let $D$ be a cell of $\mathcal{D}$ such that $B := D \cap \fr{ C } \neq \emptyset$ and $B \neq D$. Then either

  1. $C$ is a $1$-dimensional section cell whose endpoint, $B$, projects on a bad cell, or

  2. there exists a cell $E$ of $\mathcal{D}$ such that $\dim(E) < \dim(C)$ and $\emptyset \neq D \cap \fr{ E } \neq D$.
:::

::: {.proof}
By the proof of [@lazard10, Theorem 4.4], $D$ will always be a $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell in the cylinder above a bad cell $D'$.

We consider each case by cell index.

- $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},1)$-cell, where $\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} i_j = 1$: observe that $C$ (if bounded) is delineated by some $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cells (one-dimensional curve intervals). Take $B$ to be the one-dimensional interval delineated by the endpoints of these curves. Since $B \neq C$, at least one of these endpoints is not a $(0,\ldots,0,0)$-cell of $\cal D$. Case 2 applies, taking as $E$ the delineating $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cell.

- $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cells, where $\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} i_j = 1$: consider the previous case, letting $C = E$.

- $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cell, where $\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} i_j = 2$:
$C$ is necessarily the root of a polynomial $f \in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ which vanishes identically on $D'$, a $(0,\ldots,0)$ cell in the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{n-1}$.
Let $V_r$ be a small neighbourhood (with radius $r > 0$) centred around $D'$ and consider $V_r'$, the cylinder above the boundary of $V_r$. Since $C$ is a monotone cell, the maximum and minimum values of $x_n$ in this intersection are obtained on the boundary of $C$, for sufficiently small $r$. The limits, as $r$ tends to $0$, of this maximum and minimum clearly belong to the boundary of $B$, if these limits do not tend to infinity. Note that both the maximum and minimum cannot be infinite, since this would imply that either $B$ is empty, or coincides with $D$. Therefore, the non-infinite limits are the endpoints of some $1$-dimensional cell belonging to the boundary of $C$. Case 2 applies, taking $E$ to be this $1$-dimensional cell.

- $(0,\ldots,0,1)$- or $(0,\ldots,0,0)$-cells: do not satisfy the hypothesis, there is nothing to do.
:::

::: {.remark}
Let $C$ be a $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1},0)$-cell as described in Lemma \@ref(lem:ext-lazard-5-13) such that $i_1=i_k = 1$ for some $1 \le k \le n$ and all other elements of the index are equal to zero.
The cell $D$, which projects on a bad-cell is necessarily a $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell and the cell $E$, which has dimension one, is contained in $\cl{C}$. Hence, $E$ must have index either $(i_1,0\ldots,0)$ or $(0,\ldots,0,i_k,0,\ldots,0)$.
By Proposition \@ref(prp:delete-zero-index) (@bgv15, Lemma 3.3), the images of $C$, $D$ and $E$ under the projection map $\projops{i_1,i_k,i_n}$ are cylindrical cells and satisfy Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-13) (@lazard10, Lemma 5.13).

This implies that we should be able to use a similar technique to that described in Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-14) (@lazard10, Proposition 5.14) to lift above bad cells and satisfy the frontier condition on two-dimensional section cells in decompositions of arbitrary dimension.

with each $h_i \in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$, and
$$\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1})$$
be a common root of $h_d,\ldots,h_1,h_0$.
Let $g_1,\ldots,g_{n-2}\in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$ be irreducible, pairwise relatively prime polynomials having $\mathbf{p}$ as a root.
Then the limits of the common roots of $f$ and $g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}$ for $\{i_1,\ldots,i_{n-2}\} = \{1,\ldots,n-1\} \setminus \ell, 1 \le \ell \le n-1$ as $(x_1, \ldots,x_{n-1}) \to \mathbf{p}, (x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}) \ne \mathbf{p}$ may be computed as the solutions of a system of polynomial equations having dimension zero.
:::

::: {.proof}
Since $f$ is irreducible, it has at least $2$ coefficients, $h_1,h_2 \in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$, whose GCD is a constant.
Therefore, any ideal generated by these coefficients has codimension at least two and, since polynomials $g_1,\ldots,g_{n-1}$ are irreducible and pairwise relatively prime, the ideal generated by the coefficients of $f$ and the polynomials, $g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}$ has dimension zero.
Any ideal containing these polynomials also contains another element, $g_\ell$, which is not a multiple of any of the $g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}$'s.

The saturation by $g_\ell$ of the ideal $\langle f, g_{i_1}, \ldots, g_{i_{n-2}} \rangle$ is defined as the ideal
$$
S := \langle f, g_{i_1}, \ldots, g_{i_{n-2}}, 1 - z g_\ell \rangle \cap \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n].
$$
The irreducible components of the zero set of $S$ are those of the zero set of $\langle f,g_{i_1},\ldots,i_{n-2} \rangle$ at which $g_\ell$ is not identically zero. It follows that the vertical line $\{ x_1 = p_1, \ldots, x_{n-1} = p_{n-1} \}$ which is part of the zero set of $f$,
$g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}$ and $g_\ell$, is not contained in the zero set of $S$.
Meanwhile, the zero set of $S$ contains the limit points we want to find.

Therefore, the ideal generated by $S$, the coefficients $h_0,\ldots,h_d$ of $f$ and the polynomials $g_{i_1},\ldots,g_{i_{n-2}}$ is zero-dimensional and the limits of $\{ f = 0, g_{i_1} = 0, \ldots, g_{i_{n-n}} = 0 \}$ as $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) \to \mathbf{p}$ can be computed as the solutions of $S$.

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$ invariant CAD of $\R^n$ as constructed by the algorithm in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm).
Recall that, for the previous results, we require the decomposition induced on $\R^{n-1}$ to be strong about the projections of some cells of $\mathcal{D}$. Therefore, we need to proceed by induction on decompositions induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^k, k \ge 1$ to be able to apply Lemma \@ref(lem:ext-lazard-5-13) and Conjecture \@ref(cnj:ext-lazard-5-14).

For $k\le 2$, we have a $\projop{k}(\mathbf{F})$-invariant CAD which already satisfies the frontier condition by @lazard10, Corollary 4.7.
For $k=3$, recall that every cell is well-bordered by Proposition \@ref(prp:lazard-5-4) (@lazard10, Corollary 5.4). We already described how to construct a $\projop{3}(\mathbf{F})$-invariant CAD of $\R^3$ satisfying the frontier condition using @lazard10, Algorithm 5.15.

For $k>3$ let $\mathcal{D'}$ be the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^k$ and let $C$ be a cell of
$\mathcal{D'}$ such that $\projopinv{k}(C) \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$.
By the induction hypothesis, the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D'}$ on $\R^{k-1}$ is strong about $\projop{k-1}(C)$.
$C$ is topologically regular since the projection of a monotone cell is monotone and $C$ is well-bordered by Corollary \@ref(cor:ext-lazard-5-3) since $\dim(C) \le 2$.
If $\dim(C) < 2$, $C$ already satisfies the frontier condition since it is well-bordered.
If $\dim(C') = 2$, then $C$ is an $(i_1,\ldots,i_k)$-cell such that $i_{\ell_1} = i_{\ell_2} = 1$ and all other elements of the index are equal to zero.

First suppose that $\ell_1 = 1$. If $\ell_2 < k$ then $C$ is a section cell.
Let $C' = \projop{k-1}(C)$. $C'$ satisfies the frontier condition by the induction hypothesis and $C$ is the graph of a continuous definable function $\varphi : C' \to \R$.
$\cl{C}$ is the graph of $\varphi$ for all but, possibly, a finite number of isolated blow-up points in $\cl{C'}$ (see Remark after Definition \@ref(def:blow-up-point)).
Let $\mathcal{A}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{A}_k$ be the set of projection polynomials defining $\mathcal{D'}$. By the construction of CAD, these polynomials are irreducible. Let
$$
C \subset \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^k \mid g_{j_1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, g_{j_{k-2}}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}

where each $g_i \in \mathcal{A}_i$ for $i \in \{j_1,\ldots,j_{k-2}\} = \{1,\ldots,k-1\} \setminus \{{\ell_1}, {\ell_2} \}$ and $f \in \mathcal{A}_k$.
Suppose that there is a $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell $D$ such that $D \cap \fr{C}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in D$. I.e., $\mathbf{b} := \projop{k-1}(D)$ is a bad cell and is a common root of $g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-2}}$ and some $g_{\ell_1} \in \mathcal{A}_{\ell_1}, g_{\ell_2} \in \mathcal{A}_{\ell_2}$.
Apply a method similar to that described in @lazard10, Algorithm 5.15 to $C$ and $D$ -- using Conjecture \@ref(cnj:ext-lazard-5-14), compute the saturations by $g_{\ell_1}$ and $g_{\ell_2}$, respectively:
\begin{equation}
I_1 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-2}}, g_{\ell_2}, 1 - z g_{\ell_1} \rangle \cap \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k]
(\#eq:lazard-n-1)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
I_2 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k-2}}, g_{\ell_1}, 1 - z g_{\ell_2} \rangle \cap \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k],
(\#eq:lazard-n-2)
\end{equation}
where $z$ is a new variable.
Let $S_1, S_2$ be Groebner bases for $I_1,I_2$ respectively. The union of zero-dimensional solutions to $S_1,S_2$ forms the set of refinement points $\mathcal{R}_\mathbf{b}$ whiche contains the endpoints of the open interval $D \cap \fr{C}$, By considering each bad cell in $\fr(\projop{k-1}(C))$, $\mathcal{D}'$ can be refined such that $C$ satisfies the frontier condition.

On the other hand, if $\ell_2 = k$, $C$ is a sector cell. In this case, $C$ already satisfies the frontier condition since its top and bottom, which are one-dimensional section cells, already satisfy the frontier condition and its side-wall consists of at most two connected components -- points or closed intervals, whose endpoints coincide with the endpoints of the top and bottom of $C$.

Finaly, if $\ell_1 > 1$ then $C$ is a $(0,\ldots,0,i_{\ell_1},\ldots,i_k)$-cell. Apply the method described above to the $(i_{\ell_1 + 1},\ldots,i_k)$-cell in the sub-cad above $\projop{i_\ell - 1}(C)$.

Compute a refinement of $\mathcal{D}$ so that it is compatible with the set of refinement points $\mathcal{R}_\mathbf{b}$. These are refinements of the kind described in @bgv15, Lemma 3.11, and preserve the cylindrical structure and monotone cells in $\mathcal{D}$.
By repeating this process for each bad cell $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathcal{D'}$ is refined such that it satisfies the frontier
condition, hence it is strong about each cell $C$ such that $\projopinv{k}(C) \subset V_1\cup \ldots, \cup V_k$. This completes the inductive step and, by induction, a cylindrical decomposition monotone with respect to each set $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ and satisfying the frontier condition has been constructed.

### Algorithm for lifting above bad points, for CAD compatible with sets of dimension $\le 2$ { #sec:ext-lazard-algorithm }

Let $\cal D$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant cylindrical algebraic decomposition of $\R^n$ monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set $V_1,\ldots, V_k$ such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2, 1,\le i \le k$ (e.g., the output produced by the algorithm from Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm)).
We now extend @lazard10, Algorithm 5.15 to CAD of this kind.
First, prepare $\mathcal{D}$ by marking each cell $C' := \projop{r}(C)$, such that $C'$ is a two-dimensional section cell in the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^r$ such that $C$ is a cell of $\mathcal{D}$ contained in $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ for $3 \le r \le n$.

::: {.algorithm data-latex="Extension of Lazard's Lifting With Bad Points, for $2$-dimensional cells in $\R^n$"}
[Extension of @lazard10, Algorithm 5.15]

**Input:**
$$({\cal D}, {\cal A})$$

  - $\cal D$: a CAD of $\R^k$, each cell having constant sign on $\mathcal{A}$, A collection of cells $\mathcal{C} := \{ C_1,\ldots,C_m \}$ of $\mathcal{D}$ are marked as being projections of $V_1,\ldots,V_k$.

  - ${\cal A} = {\cal A}_1,\ldots,{\cal A}_k$ is the family of projection polynomials for $\mathcal{D}$, each ${\cal A}_k \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k]$.

**Output:**

$$
{\cal R} := \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} = \{ c_1,\ldots,c_t \} \subset \A \}
$$
where $\mathbf{b} \in \R^{k-1}$ is a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell in the decomposition induced by ${\cal E}$ on $\R^k$.

A set of refinement points, as described in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-algorithm).

- Let $\cal D'$ be the decomposition induced by $\cal D$ on $\R^{n-1}$.

- For each $(i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1},0)$-cell $E \in \cal{C}$, let $i_{\ell_1} = i_{\ell_2} = 1$, while all other elements in the index are equal to zero.

  - Let $\mathbf{c} := \projop{\ell_1 - 1}(E)$ and compute the set of polynomials for the sub-cad of $\mathcal{D}$ above $\mathbf{c}$.

    I.e., Let $C := \projops{x_{\ell_1},\ldots,x_k}(E)$ be an $(i_{\ell_1},\ldots,i_{k-1},0)$-cell in the sub-cad of $\mathcal{D}$ above $\mathbf{c}$. Compute the substitution of polynomials
    $$
    \mathcal{A'}_{j} := \{ {\mathrm{sub}}_{\mathbf{c}} (f) \in \Z[x_{\ell_1},\ldots,x_j] \mid f \in \mathcal{A}_{j - \ell_1 + 1} \}
    $$
    for $\ell_1 \le j \le k$.

  - Find, by examining signs of projection polynomials associated to $C$, polynomials
    $$
    (g_{j_1},\ldots,g_{k - \ell_1 + 1}, f), g_j \in \mathcal{A'}_j, j \in \{\ell_1,\ldots,k-1\} \setminus \{ \ell_1, \ell_2 \}, f \in \mathcal{A'}_k
    $$
    such that $C \subset \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^{k-\ell_1 + 1} \mid (g_{j_1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0,\ldots,g_{k-3}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}$.

  - Determine whether any point on the frontier of $C$ projects on a bad cell. I.e., check if there is a $(0,\ldots,0,1)$-cell $D$, by examining signs of projection  polynomials, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in D$.

    I.e., all of $g_{j_1},\ldots,g_{j_{k - \ell_1 + 1}},f$ should be equal to zero on $D$.

  - For each $D$ projecting on a bad cell, let $\mathbf{b} := \projop{k-1}(D)$.

    Since $\mathbf{b}$ is a $(0,\ldots,0)$-cell, polynomials $g_{j_1},\ldots,g_{j_{k - \ell_1 + 1}}$ are equal to zero on $\mathbf{b}$ and there are two more polynomials $g_{\ell_1} \in \mathcal{A'}_{\ell_1}, g_{\ell_2} \in \mathcal{A'}_{\ell_2}$ which are equal to zero on $\mathbf{b}$.

    - Compute saturations $$
    I_1 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k - \ell_1 + 1}}, g_{\ell_2}, 1 - z g_{\ell_1} \rangle \cap \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k]
    $$
    and
    $$
    I_2 := \langle f, g_{j_1}, \ldots, g_{j_{k - \ell_1 + 1}}, g_{\ell_1}, 1 - z g_{\ell_2} \rangle \cap \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_k],
    $$
    where $z$ is a new variable.

    - Compute generator systems $S_1, S_2$ for $I_1,I_2$ respectively.

      This may be done by computing a Groebner basis eliminating $z$.

    - Finally, to obtain  refinement polynomials for $D$, substitute
    $$
    L := \{ {\mathrm{sub}}_{\mathbf{b}}(f) \in \Q[x_k] \mid f \in S_1 \cup S_2 \}.
    $$

    - Refinement points are the roots
    $$
    (c_1,\ldots,c_t)
    $$
    of polynomials in $L$.

    - Let
    $$
    {\cal R} := {\cal R} \cup \{ {\cal R}_{\mathbf{b}} = (c_1,\ldots,c_t) \}.
    $$

- return $\cal R$.
:::

Apply this procedure to each decomposition, for $3 \le k \le n$ induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^k$ and compute the refinement of sections above bad cells using the same method described in Section \@ref(sec:compute-refinement) to obtain a refinement $\mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{D}$. Note that, since refinement points are algebraic numbers splitting $(1)$-cells in induced decompositions, @bgv15, Lemma 3.11 asserts that the cylindrical structure and monotone cells are preserved in $\mathcal{E}$.

### Correctness and complexity

Since zero- and one-dimensional cells already satisfy the frontier condition, it suffices to consider cells of dimension two.
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a CAD of $\R^k$ and $C$ be a two-dimensional section cell of $\mathcal{D}$ such that the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^{k-1}$ is strong about $C$. Corollary \@ref(cor:ext-lazard-5-3) asserts that $C$ is well-bordered, so its frontier consists of the closure of some one-dimensional cells of $\mathcal{D}$. The frontier condition fails in the region of sector cells of $\mathcal{D}$ above $0$-dimensional "bad" cells in the decomposition induced by $\mathcal{D}$ on $\R^{k-1}$.
The procedure described above explains how to obtain some new polynomials which allow these one-dimensional sectors to be refined such that they are compatible with the frontier of $C$. By performing this refinement, $C$ is made to satisfy the forntier condition.

If $C$ is a $2$-dimensional sector cell, then its top and bottom are $1$-dimensional sector cells of $\mathcal{D}$ and the side-wall of $C$ is contained in cylinders $\mathbf{c} \times \R$, where $\mathbf{c}$ is a zero-dimensional cell which is an endpoint of $\projop{k-1}(C)$. It follows that $C$ satisfies the frontier condition since its top and bottom, which are one-dimensional cells, satisfy the frontier condition.

#### Complexity analysis

We will see, in Section \@ref(sec:novel-frontier), that there is an algorithm for obtaining the frontier condition on a CAD compatible with a semialgebraic set of arbitrary dimension. This algorithm has complexity $(sd)^{O(1)^{n2^n}}$ -- triply exponential in the number of variables. However, in the particular case of semialgebraic sets having dimension at most two, the complexity may be lower. This is now discussed.

Let us first discuss complexity in relation to the procedure described by @bgv15 in Theorem 3.20. Given the family $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, $\fr{C}$ is computed for each $2$-dimensional cell $C \subset V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k$ According to Lemma \@ref(lem:frontier), there is an algorithm, which uses @bpr2006 Algorithm 14.21 as its main subroutine, for computing $\fr{C}$, having complexity $$
(sd)^{O(n^2)},
$$
where $C$ is defined by $s$ different polynomials of maximum degree $d$.
$C$ has constant sign on all polynomials defining the CAD, so, using the bounds discussed in Sections \@ref(sec:quasi-complexity) and \@ref(sec:monotone-complexity), the complexity upper bound for computing $\fr{C}$ is
$$
\left(\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\cdot\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}\right)^{O(n^2)},
$$
which is asymptotically the same as
$$
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}..
$$
Note that, in some cases, only some of the $\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(1)^{n}}$ polynomials are required to define the cell $C$.
This is, according to Lemma \@ref(lem:frontier), an upper bound on the number of polynomials and their degrees in the QFF defining $\fr{C}$.
The procedure requires us to partition $\fr{C}$ into points and monotone curve intervals.
In order to do this, a similar process  that used to obtain monotone cells (see Section \@ref(sec:monotone-cells)) can be used. This will be repeated for each of the $2$-dimensional cells contained in $V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k$. As such, the overall complexity will be the same as that presented in Section \@ref(sec:monotone-complexity). I.e.,
$$
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
$$

Now let us consider the extension of @lazard10, discussed in Section \@ref(sec:lazard-n).
For each $1$-dimensional sector cell which projects on a $0$-dimensional bad cell, the saturation of ideals, defined in Equations \@ref(eq:lazard-n-1) and \@ref(eq:lazard-n-2) are computed. There will be at most $n$ polynomials, in $n+1$ variables, appearing in these ideals. The saturation of these ideals is computed by finding a Groebner basis for them.
According to @lakshman1991, if the ideal $I = \langle f_1,\ldots,f_k\rangle$ where $f_1,\ldots,f_k$ are polynomials in $n$ variables, then a Groebner basis for $I$ can be computed in time singly exponential in $n$.
However, in our case, only the saturation of the ideal over the real numbers is zero-dimensional, rather than the
original ideal over complex numbers before eliminating the new variable $z$. Therefore, the complexity of computing a
Groebner basis is doubly exponential in the number of variables -- $2^{2^n}$ [@mayr1997]. In the worst case, we may be considering a $(1,1,0,\ldots,0)$-cell, part of whose frontier projects on a bad $(0,0)$-cell in the induced decomposition of $\R^2$. It follows that at most $n-2$ Groebner basis computations will be required. Thus, the total complexity for lifting above a bad cell is at most
$$
n \cdot 2^{2^n} = 2^{n 2^n}.
$$
The bound on the number of bad cells is unknown, but it is obviously bounded from above by the total number of cells in the induced decomposition of $\R^{n-1}$. I.e., $(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n-1}}$.
It follows that the complexity of the algorithm arising from the generalisation of Lazard is
$$
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n-1}} \cdot 2^{n 2^n},
$$
which is bounded from above by
$$
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
$$

Both approaches -- @bgv15 and the generalisation of @lazard10 -- have the same complexity upper bound.

To summarise, each of the three stages -- quasi-affine, monotone and frontier condition -- of the algorithm for computing a CAD which is monotone with respect to all $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ for all $1 \le i \le k$, and satisfying the frontier condition each has complexity $(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}$.
Thus, the overall complexity of this algorithm is
$$
(s(d+1))^{O(1)^{n}}.
$$
By Proposition \@ref(prp:collins), this is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials and their degrees defining this CAD.

Recall that the complexity of computing a "classical" CAD (from Proposition \@ref(prp:collins)) is $$
(sd)^{O(1)^n}.
$$
Therefore, the monotone CAD algorithm has, as expected, a slightly higher complexity than that of the classical algorithm.
However, the complexity is not significantly worse, still being doubly exponential in the number of variables.
This discussion completes the proof of Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-algorithm).
