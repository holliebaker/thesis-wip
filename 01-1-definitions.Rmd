### Sets definable over O-minimal structures

We will be working mostly in the category *Semialgebraic Set* and sometimes in the more general category of sets definable over an O-minimal structures.
A semialgebraic subset of $\R^n$ is the set of points in $\R^n$ satisfying a Boolean combination of polynomial equations and inequalities with coefficients in $\R$.

::: { .definition #semialgebraic-set }
The semialgebraic subsets of $\R^n$ are the smallest class ${SA}_n$ of subsets of $\R^n$ satisfying the following properties.

1. If $f \in \R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, then $\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}$ and $\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}$ are elements of ${SA}_n$.
1. If $A, B \in {SA}_n$, then $A \cup B$, $A \cap B$ and $\R^n \setminus A$ are elements of ${SA}_n$.
:::

::: {.definition}
Let $X \subset \R^n$ and $Y \subset \R^m$. A mapping $f : X \to Y$ is called semialgebraic if its graph
$$
\{ (\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x})) \in \R^{n+m} \mid \mathbf{x} \in X \}
$$
is a semialgebraic set.
:::

A semialgebraic set can be represented as either a quantifier-free or first-order Boolean formula.

::: { .definition #qff }
A quantifier-free Boolean formula is obtained by the following rules:

1. If $f \in \R[x_1\ldots,x_n]$ then $f=0$ and $f>0$ are quantifier-free Boolean formulas,
2. if $F$ and $G$ are quantifier-free Boolean formulas then $F \land G$, $F \lor G$ and $\neg F$ are quantifier-free Boolean formulas.
:::

::: { .definition }
A first-order Boolean formula is obtained by rules 1 and 2 from Definition @\ref(def:qff) and

3. If $F$ is a first-order Boolean formula and $y$ is a variable ranging over $\R$, then $\exists y\ F$ and $\forall y\ F$ are first-order Boolean formulas.
:::

A fundamental result in semialgebraic geometry is the Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem.

::: { .theorem #tarski-seinedberg }
[@vdd1998
Let $S \subset \R^{n+1}$ and $\projop{n} : \R^{n+1} \to \R^n$ be the projection map onto the first $n$ co-ordinates. Then $\projop{n}(S) \subset \R^n$ is a semialgebraic set.
:::

One important consequence of this theorem is that quantifier elimination is possible over real numbers. In other words, a subset of $\R^n$ defined by a first-order formula with quantifiers is semialgebraic and can be represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formmula. One useful application of this theorem is that the closure, $\cl(S)$, of any semialgebraic set $S \subset \R^n$ is also semialgebraic.

::: { .proposition #union-of-conjunctionss }
Every semialgebraic subset of $\R^n$ is the (not necessarily disjoint) union of finitely many semialgebraic subsets of the kind
$$
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \land g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \land \cdots \land g_k(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}
$$
where $k \in \N$ and $f,g_1,\ldots,g_k \in \R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
:::

This follows from the fact that the class of finite unions of this kind satisfy properties listed in Definition \@ref(def:semialgebraic-set).

We now define the O-minimal structures over the reals.

::: {.definition #definable-set}
A structure expanding the real closed field $R$ is a collection $$
S := (S^n)_{n \in \N}
$$
where each $S^n$ is a set of subsets of the affine space $R^n$ satisfying the following conditions.

1. All algebraic subsets of $R^n$ are in $S^n$.
1. $S^n$ is a Boolean subalgebra of the powerset of $R^n$.
1. If $A \in S^n$ and $B \in S^m$, then $A \times B \in S^{n+m}$.
1. Let $\proj : R^{n+1} \to R^n$ be the projection onto the first $n$ coordinates. If $X\in R^{n+1}$, then $\proj(X) \in R^n$.
:::

::: {.definition #o-minimal-structure}
A structure $S$ satisfying the properties of a definable set (listed in Definition \@ref(def:definable-set)) and

5. The elements of $S^1$ consist of the finite unions of points and open intervals of $R$.
:::

::: {.definition #definable-function}
A map $f : A \to R^m$, where $A \subset R^n$, is called *definable* if its graph $G \subset R^{n+m}$ is a definable set.
:::

::: {.remark}
Since definable sets are closed under projection, it can be easily deduced that $A$ is a definable set.
:::

::: {.remark}
For convenience, we will call a definable map $f : R^n \to R$ a definable function.
:::

It is easy to see that semialgebraic sets satisfy the properties of sets definable in an O-minimal structure over the reals. Another example is the sub-pfaffian sets.

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 2.1]
A Pfaffian chain of order $r \ge 0$ and degree $\alpha \ge 1$ in an open domain $G \subset \R^n$ is a sequence of analytic functions
$$
f_1, \ldots , f_r
$$
in $G$ satisfying the differential equations
$$
{df}_j(\mathbf{x}) = \sum^n_{i=1} g_{ij}(\mathbf{x}, f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_j(\mathbf{x})) dx_i
$$
for $1 \le j \le r$, where $g_{ij}(x_1,\ldots,x_n),y_1,\ldots,y_j)$ are polynomials of degree not greater than $\alpha$.

A function $f(\mathbf{x}) = P(\mathbf{x},f_1(\mathbf{x}),\ldots,f_r(\mathbf{x}))$, where $P(\mathbf{x}, f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_r(\mathbf{x}))$ is a polynomial of degree not greater than $\beta \ge 1$ is called a Pfaffian function of order $r$ and degree $(\alpha, \beta)$. Note that $f$ is only defined in the domain $G$, where all functions $f_1,\ldots,f_r$ are analytic, even if $f$ itself can be extended as an analytic function in a larger domain.
:::

Examples of Pfaffian functions include the exponential, logarithmic, reciprocal and trigonometric functions, as well as the polynomials.

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 2.7]
A set $X \subset \R^n$ is called semi-Pfaffian in an open domain
$G \subset \R^n$ if it consists of points in $G$ satisfying a Boolean combination $F$ of some atomic equations and inequalities $f = 0$, $g > 0$, where $f, g$ are Pfaffian functions having a common Pfaffian chain defined in $G$.

$X$ is called restricted in $G$ if $\cl(X)$ is contained in $G$.

$X$ is called basic if the Boolean combination $F$ is a conjuction.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 2.8]
A set $X \subset \R^n$ is called sub-Pfaffian in an open domain $G \subset \R^n$ if
$$
X := \projop{n}(Y),
$$
where $Y \subset \R^m$ is a semi-Pfaffian set and $\R^n$ is a subspace of $\R^m$.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, 2.9]
Let ${\cal I}^k := [-1,1]^k$ be the closed cube in an open domain $G \subset \R^k$.
$X \subset {\cal I}^n$ is called restricted sub-Pfaffian if $X := \projop{n}(Y)$, where $Y \subset {\cal I}^{n+m}$ is a restricted semi-Pfaffian set.
:::

The restricted sub-pfaffian sets form a Boolean subalgebra. Restricted sub-pfaffian sets are clearly closed under taking finite unions and intersections. The property that the compliment of restricted sub-pfaffian set is restricted sub-pfaffian is a particular case of Gabrielov's compliment theorem [@gabrielov1996]. The restriction to the closed cube ensures that the restricted sub-Pfaffian sets are definable in an O-minimal structure. Furthermore, @gv01 present an algorithm for constructing a cylindrical decomposition compatible with a restricted sub-Pfaffian set. Note that these properties and results may not be applied to (restricted) semi-Pfaffian sets. Since polynomials are a type of Pfaffian function, semialgebraic sets are a particular case of restricted sub-Pfaffian sets.


### Monotone cells

It is clear from the definition that a set definable in an O-minimal structure is also a definable set and a semialgebraic set is definable in an O-minimal structure. In this section, we will introduce, closely following @bgv15, some properties of definable sets which are also applicable to semialgebraic sets.

::: { .definition #affine-coordinate-subspace }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.1]
Let $L_{j,c} := \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mid x_j = c \}$ for some $1 \le j \le n$ and $c \in \R$.
Each intersection of the kind
$$
S := L_{j_1,c_1} \cap \ldots \cap L_{j_m,c_m}
$$
where $0 \le j \le m$, $1 \le j_1 < \cdots < j_m \le n$ and $c_1,\ldots,c_m \in \R$ is called an affine coordinate subspace of $\R^n$.
:::

::: { .definition }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.2]
Let $\mathbf{f} = (f_1,\ldots,f_k) : X \to \R^k$ be a bounded continuous map defined on an open, bounded, non-empty subset $X \subset \R^n$ having the graph $Y \subset \R^{n+k}$.

$\mathbf{f}$ is called quasi-affine if, for any coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^{n+k}$, the restriction $\proj_{L}\vert_Y$ is injective if and only if $\proj_{L}(Y)$ is $n$-dimensional.
:::

::: { .definition #monotone-map }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.3]
Let $\mathbf{f} : X \to \R^k$ be a bounded, continuous, quasi-affne map defined on an open, bounded, non-empty subset $X\subset \R^n$ having the graph $Y \subset \R^{n+k}$. $\mathbf{f}$ is called monotone if, for each affine coordinate subspace $S \subset \R^{n+k}$, the intersection $Y \cap S$ is connected.
:::

::: { .definition #monotone-map-on }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.10]
Let $X \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ be a monotone cell and $\mathbf{f} : X \to \opspan{y_1,\ldots,y_k}$ be a continuous map having graph $Y \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_k}. If $Y$ is a monotone cell, then $\mathbf{f}$ is called monotone on $X$.
:::

::: { .definition #monotone-cell }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.5]
$Y \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ is called a monotone cell if it is the graph of a monotone map $\mathbf{f} : X \to H$ where $H \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ and $X \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n} \setminus H$.
:::

::: { .example }
1. Observe that any quasi-affine map defined on a connected subset and having the graph in $\R^2$ is also monotone. This quasi-affine map will fail to be monotone if the set it is defined on is not connected.

2. Let $\Delta := \{ 0 < x < 1, y > 0, x + y < 1 \} \subset \R^2$ and $\varphi(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$. Let $Y \subset \R^3$ be the graph of function $\phi$ on $\Delta$. Observe that $\phi\vert_Delta$ is a quasi-affine map. However, $y \cap \{ z = 3/4 \}$ is not connected, hence $\phi\vert_\Delta$ is not a monotone function.
:::

** TODO: Notation 2.4 about $\opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ seems quite complicated. Why is the complicated explanation needed. **

** TODO 2 figure 1 shows examples of monotone (and not monotone) cells **

::: { .proposition #monotone-topologically-regular }
[@bgv13, Theorem 1]
Every monotone cell is a topologically regular cell.
:::

The following properties of monotone cells are used in the proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20.

::: { .corollary }
[@bgv13, Corollary 7, Theorem 11]
Let $X \subset \R^n$ be a monotone cell, then

1. $X \cap \{ x_i < c \}$, $X \cap \{ x_i = c \}$ and $X \cap \{ x_i > c \}$, for every $1 \le i \le n$ and $c \in \R$, are either empty or monotone cells.
1. Let $Y \subset X$ be a monotone cell such that $\dim(Y) = \dim(X) - 1$ and $\fr(Y) \subset \fr(X)$. Then $X \setminus Y$ is a disjoint union of two monotone cells.
:::

::: { .proposition }
[@bgv13, Theorem 10]
Let $X \subset \R^n$ be a monotone cell. Then $\proj_{L}(X)$, for any affine coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^n$ is also a monotone cell.
:::

::: { .remark #monotone-proj-basis }
[@bgv15, Remark 2.11]
Let $Y \subset \R^n$ be a monotone cell and $L$ be a coordinate subspace such that $\proj_L\vert_Y$ is injective.
Then $Y$ is the graph of a monotone map defined on $\proj_L(Y)$, by [@bgv13, Theorem 7 and Corollary 5].

### Cylindrical Algebraic Decompositions

> A section cell $C$ is the graph, in $\R^n$, of a continuous definable function $h : C' \to \R$, where $C'$ is a cylindrical cell in $\R^{n-1}$.

In reality, we are given a set of *level-$n$ projection factors* and $C$ is a real root of a polynomial $f \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, viewed as a polynomial in $\Z[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]$. By the construction of CAD, $f$ has $k$ real roots at every point $\mathbf{c} \in C'$.

In some situations, the former representation (with functions) is more convenient (than the latter, with roots).

Observe that it is easy to convert from the function representation to the root representation. Indeed, let $C\subset R^{n}$ be the graph of
$$h : C' \to \R$$
where $C' \subset \R^{n-1}$ is an $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})$-cell in $\R^{n-1}$. For every $\mathbf{c} \in C'$, the graph $C$ can be written as a root of
$$
f := h(\mathbf{c}) - x_n \in Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
$$
The specific root of $f$ such that $x_n = h(\mathbf{c})$ can be isolated, by Thom's lemma, by adding some sign conditions on partial derivatives of $g$.

Now let $f \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}][x_n]$ be a polynomial in $x_n$ and $C' \subset \R^{n-1}$ be a $(i_1,\ldots,i_{n-1})$-cell of $\R^{n-1}$. Then the cylinder $C' \times \R$ ("above" $C'$) contains a family of section cells
$$
{\cal C} := \{ (\mathbf{c},x_n) \mid \mathbf{c} \in C', f(\mathbf{c},x_n) = 0 \}.
$$
The family $\cal C$ consists of $k$ connected semialgebraic sets, corresponding to the $k$ section cells on which $f = 0$.
Suppose we want to represent one of these section cells $C \in {\cal C}$ as the graph of $h : C' \to \R$. By Thom's lemma, we can write
$$
C = \{ (\mathbf{c},x_n) \mid \mathbf{c} \in C', f(\mathbf{c},x_n) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{c},x_n) > 0, \ldots, g_k(\mathbf{c},x_n) \}
$$
where $g_1,\ldots,g_k$ are partial derivatives of $f$.

$C$ is a semialgebraic set, therefore $h$ is certainly a definable function.
But, is $h$ a polynomial? The answer is no. This can be seen using a simple example.

::: {.example}
Let $D \subset \R^2$ be the unit disc, a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula
$$
\{ x^2 + y^2 < 1 \}.
$$
Construct a CAD of $\R^2$ compatible with $D$ in which $D$ is a single sector cell. Observe that the top of $D$,
$$
D_T = \{ -1 < x < 1, y > 0, x^2 + y^2 = 0 \}
$$
and
$$
D' := \projop{1}(D) = \{ -1 < x < 1 \}.
$$
It is clear that $D_T$ is a semialgebraic (and therefore a definable) set, so there exists a definable function
$$
h : D' \to \R
$$
such that $D_T$ is the graph of $h\vert_{D'}$. Indeed, let
$$
h(x) = +\sqrt{1-x^2}.
$$
This is clearly not a polynomial.
:::

In addition, it's clear that not every definable set is the graph of a definable map. Indeed, consider
$$
C := \{ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}
$$
and
$$
C' := \projop{1}(C) = \{ -1 \le x \le 1 \}.
$$
Both $C$ and $C'$ are clearly definable, but there is no map from $C' \to \R$ having $C$ as its graph. Indeed, at $x=0$, this map should have images $-1$ and $1$, which contradicts the definition of a map. However, in the case of a cylindrical section cell, the map $h$ always exists by definition.

Therefore, when working with cylindrical section cells, the map $h : C' \to \R$ may be used, but algorithms will work solely with polynomials $f \in \Z{x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}}[x_n]$ from the level-$n$ projection factor set.
