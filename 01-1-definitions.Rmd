## Semialgebraic sets and monotone cells

### Sets definable over O-minimal structures

We will be working mostly in the category *SemialgebraicSet* of semialgebraic sets and sometimes in the more general category of sets definable over an O-minimal structure.

We first define the O-minimal structures over the reals.

::: {.definition #definable-set}
A structure expanding the real numbers $\R$ is a collection $$
S := (S^n)_{n \in \N}
$$
where each $S^n$ is a set of subsets of the affine space $\R^n$ satisfying the following conditions.

1. All algebraic subsets of $\R^n$ are in $S^n$;
2. $S^n$ is a Boolean subalgebra of the powerset of $\R^n$;
3. If $A \in S^n$ and $B \in S^m$, then $A \times B \in S^{n+m}$;
4. Let $\proj : \R^{n+1} \to \R^n$ be the projection onto the first $n$ coordinates. If $X\in S^{n+1}$, then $\proj(X)
\in S^n$.

Elements of $S^n$ are called the definable subsets of $\R^n$ and a definable subset of $\R^n$ may also be referred to as a definable set.
If the structure $S$ satisfies properties 1-4 and the following property, it is called an O-minimal structure.

5. The elements of $S^1$ consist of the finite unions of points and open intervals of $\R$.
:::

The "O" in O-minimal stands for order, as every O-minimal structure requires the underlying set to be ordered.

::: {.definition #definable-function}
A map $f : A \to \R^m$, where $A \subset \R^n$, is called definable if its graph $G \subset \R^{n+m}$ is a definable set.
:::

::: {.remark}
Since definable sets are closed under projection, it can be easily deduced that $A$ is a definable set.
:::

::: {.remark}
For convenience, we will call a definable map $f : \R^n \to \R$ a definable function.
:::

::: {.definition #graph-def-map }
Let $X \subset \R^n$ and $Y \subset \R^m$ be definable sets (see Definition \@ref(def:definable-set)).
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a definable map from $X$ to $Y$. The graph of $f$ is the definable set
$$
\{ (\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x})) \in \R^{n+m} \mid \mathbf{x} \in X \}.
$$
Sometimes, the domain of $f$ is $\R^n$. In this case, we often use the restriction $f\vert_X$ so that only images of $f$ at points in $X$ are considered.
:::

We now define the semialgebraic sets.

::: { .definition #semialgebraic-set }
The semialgebraic subsets of $\R^n$ are the smallest class ${SA}_n$ of subsets of $\R^n$ satisfying the following properties.

1. If $f \in \R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, then $\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}$ and $\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n
\mid f(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}$ are elements of ${SA}_n$;
1. If $A, B \in {SA}_n$, then $A \cup B$, $A \cap B$ and $\R^n \setminus A$ are elements of ${SA}_n$.
:::

::: {.remark}
It is easy to see that semialgebraic sets satisfy the properties of sets definable in an O-minimal structure over the
reals. Another example is the sub-Pfaffian sets (see Definition \@ref(def:pfaff)).
:::

::: {.definition}
Let $X \subset \R^n$ and $Y \subset \R^m$ be definable sets. A definable map $f : X \to Y$ is called semialgebraic if its graph (see Definition \@ref(def:graph-def-map))
$$
\{ (\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x})) \in \R^{n+m} \mid \mathbf{x} \in X \}
$$
is a semialgebraic set.
:::

A semialgebraic set can be represented as a first-order Boolean formula with or without quantifiers. A first-order formula which does not contain quantifiers will be called a quantifier-free Boolean formula.

::: { .definition #qff }
A quantifier-free Boolean formula $F$ is constructed using the following rules:

1. If $f \in \R[x_1\ldots,x_n]$ then $f=0$ and $f>0$ are quantifier-free Boolean formulas;
2. if $F_1$ and $F_2$ are quantifier-free Boolean formulas, then $F_1 \land F_2$, $F_1 \lor F_2$ and $\neg F_1$ are quantifier-free Boolean formulas.
:::

::: { .definition #first-order-formula }
A first-order Boolean formula $F$ is constructed using rules 1 and 2 from Definition \@ref(def:qff) and the following
rule.

3. If $F'$ is a first-order Boolean formula and $y$ is a variable ranging over $\R$, then $\exists y\ F'$ and $\forall
y\ F'$ are first-order Boolean formulas.
:::

Semialgebraic sets are closed under taking finite unions and intersections and the difference of two semialgebraic sets is semialgebraic.
A fundamental result in semialgebraic geometry is the Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem, which asserts that semialgebraic sets are also closed under taking projection.

::: { .theorem #tarski-seinedberg }
[@tarski1951]
Let $S \subset \R^{n+1}$ and $\projop{n} : \R^{n+1} \to \R^n$ be the projection map onto the first $n$ co-ordinates. Then $\projop{n}(S) \subset \R^n$ is a semialgebraic set.
:::

One important consequence of this theorem is that quantifier elimination is possible over real numbers. In other words, a subset of $\R^n$ defined by a first-order formula with quantifiers is semialgebraic and can be represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula.
Since the closure of a semialgebraic set may be represented by a first-order Boolean formula with quantifiers, it follows from the Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem that the closure of a semialgebraic set is a semialgebraic set.

We present an algorithm for performing quantifier elimination over real numbers. This algorithm will be used to provide theoretical complexity bounds for solving quantifier elimination problems later.

::: { .proposition #bpr-qe }
[@bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21]

Let $y_1 < \ldots < y_k < x_1 < \ldots < x_k$ be an ordered list of variables and $K$ a real closed field. Define a first-order Boolean formula
$$
F := Q_1 (y_1,\ldots,y_{k_1}), Q_2 (y_{k_1 + 1},\ldots,y_{k_1 + k_2}) \ldots Q_\omega (y_{y_1 + \ldots + y_{\omega-1} + 1},\ldots, y_k) G
$$
where $Q_i, 1\le i \le \omega$, is a quantifier $\forall$ or $\exists$, such that $Q_i$ and $Q_{i+1}$ are different and $G$ is a quantifier-free Boolean formula containing $s$ different polynomials of maximum degree $d$ in $K[y_1,\ldots,y_k,x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
Note that variables $y_1,\ldots,y_k$ are partitioned into $\omega$ "blocks" $Y_1,\ldots,Y_\omega$ such that $Y_i, 1 \le i \le \omega$ contains $k_i$ variables, each of which is bound by the same quantifier $Q_i$.
We say that the formula $F$ contains $\omega$ quantifier alternations.

Let $S \subset \R^n$ be a semialgebraic set defined by $F$. There is a quantifier-free Boolean formula defining $s$ of the form
$$
F' := \lor_{1 \le i \le I} \land_{1 \le j \le J_i} \left( \lor_{1 \le \ell \le L_{i,j}} f_{i,j,\ell}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \ast_{i,j,\ell} 0 \right)
$$
where each $f_{i,j,n}$ is a polynomial in $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $\ast_{i,j,\ell} \in \{<, =, >\}$ determines its sign.
Bounds on this formula are as follows

- $I \le s^{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \ldots (k_\omega + 1)(n+1)}d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}$,
- $J_i \le s^{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \ldots (k_\omega + 1)}d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}$,
- $L_{i,j} \le d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}$,
- polynomials $f_{i,j,\ell}$ have maximum degree $d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)}$.

There is an algorithm, taking $F$ as input, which computes $F'$ with complexity
$$
s^{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \ldots (k_\omega + 1)(n+1)}d^{O(k_1) O(k_2) \ldots O(k_\omega)O(n)}.
$$
:::

In many quantifier elimination problems, there is only a small number of quantifier alternations and this algorithm gives a favourable complexity bound (better than, e.g., using CAD). For example, the formula for computing the closure of a semialgebraic set contains only two quantifier alternations, and this algorithm gives a complexity bound singly exponential in the number of variables (see Lemma \@ref(lem:frontier)).

Another useful property of semialgebraic sets is that they admit a basic representation, as stated below.

Every semialgebraic subset of $\R^n$ is the (not necessarily disjoint) union of finitely many semialgebraic subsets of the kind
$$
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \cdots, g_k(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}
$$
where $k \in \N$ and $f,g_1,\ldots,g_k \in \R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
:::

This follows from the fact that the class of finite unions of this kind satisfy properties listed in Definition \@ref(def:semialgebraic-set).

::: {.definition #pfaff}
[@gv04, Definition 2.1]
A Pfaffian chain of order $r \ge 0$ and degree $\alpha \ge 1$ in an open domain $G \subset \R^n$ is a sequence of analytic functions
$$
f_1, \ldots , f_r
$$
in $G$ satisfying the differential equations
$$
{df}_j(\mathbf{x}) = \sum^n_{i=1} g_{ij}(\mathbf{x}, f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_j(\mathbf{x})) dx_i
$$
for $1 \le j \le r$, where $g_{ij}(x_1,\ldots,x_n),y_1,\ldots,y_j)$ are polynomials of degree not greater than $\alpha$.

A function $f(\mathbf{x}) = P(\mathbf{x},f_1(\mathbf{x}),\ldots,f_r(\mathbf{x}))$, where $P(\mathbf{x}, f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_r(\mathbf{x}))$ is a polynomial of degree not greater than $\beta \ge 1$ is called a Pfaffian function of order $r$ and degree $(\alpha, \beta)$. Note that $f$ is only defined in the domain $G$, where all functions $f_1,\ldots,f_r$ are analytic, even if $f$ itself can be extended as an analytic function in a larger domain.
:::

Examples of Pfaffian functions include the exponential, logarithmic, reciprocal and trigonometric functions, as well as the polynomials.

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 2.7]
A set $X \subset \R^n$ is called semi-Pfaffian in an open domain
$G \subset \R^n$ if it consists of points in $G$ satisfying a Boolean combination $F$ of some atomic equations and inequalities $f = 0$, $g > 0$, where $f, g$ are Pfaffian functions having a common Pfaffian chain defined in $G$.

$X$ is called restricted in $G$ if $\cl{X}$ is contained in $G$.

$X$ is called basic if the Boolean combination $F$ is a conjunction.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 2.8]
A set $X \subset \R^n$ is called sub-Pfaffian in an open domain $G \subset \R^n$ if
$$
X := \projop{n}(Y),
$$
where $Y \subset \R^m$ is a semi-Pfaffian set and $\R^n$ is a subspace of $\R^m$.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, 2.9]
Let ${\cal I}^k := [-1,1]^k$ be the closed cube in an open domain $G \subset \R^k$.
$X \subset {\cal I}^n$ is called restricted sub-Pfaffian if $X := \projop{n}(Y)$, where $Y \subset {\cal I}^{n+m}$ is a restricted semi-Pfaffian set.
:::

The restricted sub-Pfaffian sets form a Boolean subalgebra. Restricted sub-Pfaffian sets are clearly closed under taking finite unions and intersections. The property that the compliment of restricted sub-Pfaffian set is restricted sub-Pfaffian is a particular case of Gabrielov's compliment theorem [@gabrielov1996]. The restriction to the closed cube ensures that the restricted sub-Pfaffian sets are definable in an O-minimal structure. Furthermore, @gv01 present an algorithm for constructing a cylindrical decomposition compatible with a restricted sub-Pfaffian set. Note that these properties and results may not be applied to (restricted) semi-Pfaffian sets. Since polynomials are a type of Pfaffian function, semialgebraic sets are a particular case of sub-Pfaffian sets and, due to the Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem, semialgebraics sets satisfy the compliment theorem.

::: {.definition #pfaff-format}
[@gv04, Definition 2.11]

Consider a semi-Pfaffian set
$$
X := \bigcup_{1 \le i \le M} \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^s \mid f_{i,1} = 0, \ldots, f_{i,I_i} = 0, g_{i,1} > 0, \ldots, g_{i,J_i} > 0 \} \subset G
$$
where $f_{ij}$ and $g_{ij}$ are Pfaffian functions of order $r$ and degree $(\alpha, \beta)$ defined in an open domain $G$
The format of $X$ is a tuple
$$
(r, N, \alpha, \beta, s)
$$
where $N \ge (I_1 + J_1) + \cdots + (I_M + J_M)$.

### Monotone cells

We now present, closely following @bgv15, some useful properties of definable sets. These properties can also be applied to semialgebraic sets, being a particular case of definable sets.

::: { .definition #affine-coordinate-subspace }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.1]
Let $L_{j,c} := \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mid x_j = c \}$ for some $1 \le j \le n$ and $c \in \R$.
Each intersection of the kind
$$
S := L_{j_1,c_1} \cap \ldots \cap L_{j_m,c_m}
$$
where $0 \le j \le m$, $1 \le j_1 < \cdots < j_m \le n$ and $c_1,\ldots,c_m \in \R$ is called an affine coordinate subspace of $\R^n$.
:::

::: { .definition #quasi-affine }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.2]
Let $\mathbf{f} = (f_1,\ldots,f_k) : X \to \R^k$ be a bounded continuous map defined on an open, bounded, non-empty subset $X \subset \R^n$ having the graph $Y \subset \R^{n+k}$.

$\mathbf{f}$ is called quasi-affine if, for any coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^{n+k}$, the restriction $\proj_{L}\vert_Y$ is injective if and only if $\proj_{L}(Y)$ is $n$-dimensional.
:::

::: { .definition #monotone-map }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.3]
Let $\mathbf{f} : X \to \R^k$ be a bounded, continuous, quasi-affne map defined on an open, bounded, non-empty subset $X\subset \R^n$ having the graph $Y \subset \R^{n+k}$. $\mathbf{f}$ is called monotone if, for each affine coordinate subspace $S \subset \R^{n+k}$, the intersection $Y \cap S$ is connected.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@bgv15, Notation 2.4]

Let the space $\R^n$ have coordinate functions $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
Given a subset
$$
I = \{x_{j_1}, \ldots, x_{j_m} \} \subset \{x_1 ,\ldots, x_n \},
$$ let $W$ be the linear subspace of $\R^n$ where all coordinates in $I$ are equal to zero.
We write $\opspan{x_{j_1},\ldots, x_{j_m}}$ to mean the
quotient space $\R^n / W$.
Similarly, for any affine coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^n$ on which all the
functions $x_j \in I$ are constant, we will identify $L$ with its image under the canonical surjection
to $\R^n / W$. We write $\R^k$, where $k \le n$, to mean $\opspan{x_1, \ldots, x_k }$. $\projop{x_{i_1},\ldots,x_{i_k}} : \R^n \to \opspan{x_{i_1},\ldots,x_{i_k}}$ denotes the projection map from $\R^n$ to $\opspan{x_{i_1},\ldots,x_{i_k}}$, where $\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\} \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}$.
:::

::: { .definition #monotone-map-on }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.10]
Let $X \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ be a monotone cell and $\mathbf{f} : X \to \opspan{y_1,\ldots,y_k}$ be a continuous map having graph $Y \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_k}$. If $Y$ is a monotone cell, then $\mathbf{f}$ is called monotone on $X$.
:::

::: { .definition #monotone-cell }
[@bgv15, Definition 2.5]
$Y \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ is called a monotone cell if it is the graph of a monotone map $\mathbf{f} : X \to H$ where $H \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ and $X \subset \opspan{x_1,\ldots,x_n} \setminus H$.
:::

::: { .example #monotone-cells }
1. Observe that any quasi-affine map defined on a connected subset and having the graph in $\R^2$ is also monotone. This quasi-affine map will fail to be monotone if the set it is defined on is not connected.

2. Let $\Delta := \{ 0 < x < 1, y > 0, x + y < 1 \} \subset \R^2$ and $\varphi(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$. Let $Y \subset \R^3$ be the graph of function $\phi$ on $\Delta$. Observe that $\phi\vert_Delta$ is a quasi-affine map. However, $y \cap \{ z = 3/4 \}$ is not connected, hence $\phi\vert_\Delta$ is not a monotone function [@bgv15, Example 4.3].
:::

::: { .proposition #monotone-topologically-regular }
[@bgv13, Theorem 1]

Every monotone cell is a topologically regular cell.
:::

The following properties of monotone cells are used in the proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20.

::: { .corollary }
[@bgv13, Corollary 7, Theorem 11]
Let $X \subset \R^n$ be a monotone cell, then

1. $X \cap \{ x_i < c \}$, $X \cap \{ x_i = c \}$ and $X \cap \{ x_i > c \}$, for every $1 \le i \le n$ and $c \in \R$, are either empty or monotone cells.
1. Let $Y \subset X$ be a monotone cell such that $\dim(Y) = \dim(X) - 1$ and $\fr{Y} \subset \fr{X}$. Then $X \setminus Y$ is a disjoint union of two monotone cells.
:::

::: { .proposition }
[@bgv13, Theorem 10]

Let $X \subset \R^n$ be a monotone cell. Then $\proj_{L}(X)$, for any affine coordinate subspace $L \subset \R^n$ is also a monotone cell.
:::

::: { .remark #monotone-proj-basis }
[@bgv15, Remark 2.11]
Let $Y \subset \R^n$ be a monotone cell and $L$ be a coordinate subspace such that $\proj_L\vert_Y$ is injective.
Then $Y$ is the graph of a monotone map defined on $\proj_L(Y)$, by [@bgv13, Theorem 7 and Corollary 5].
:::

We finally revise the definition of Big O notation, following @gv2009, Definition 6.1.

::: {.definition #big-o }
[@gv2009, Definition 6.1]
Let $f,g,h : \N^\ell \to \N$ be functions and $n \in \N$.

- The expression $f \le O(g)^n$ means that there exists $c \in \N$ such that $f < (cg)^n$ at every point in $\N^\ell$.
- The expression $f \le g^{O(h)}$ means that there exists a $c \in \N$ such that $f \le g^{ch}$ at every point in $\N^\ell$.
