# Notation

For section \@ref(semi-monotone-sets):

- $C$ is a 2-dimensional sector cell in $\R^\alpha$.
- $C' := \projop{\alpha-1}(C)$.
- $X := \projops{x_1,x_\alpha}(C)$ from Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-monotone)
- $X' := \projop{1}(C)$.
- $f,g:C'\to\R$ are continuous definable functions of which $C_B,C_T$ (respectively) is the graph
- $\mathbf{h} : X'\to \opspan{x_2,\ldots,x_{\alpha-1}}$ is the quasi-affine map defining $C' \subset \R^{\alpha - 1}$.
- $\phi,\psi : X' \to \R$ defines (in $\opspan{x_1,x_\alpha}$) the top and bottom of $X$.
