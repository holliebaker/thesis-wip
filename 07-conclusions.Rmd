## Conclusions

This thesis makes three main contributions:

1. an implementation of a smooth stratification algorithm, based on the work of @gv1995;
1. a concrete algorithm and implementation for constructing a CAD, monotone with respect to semialgebraic sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k \subset \R^n$ such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$, and satisfying the frontier condition;
1. and a novel algorithm for constructing a CAD, satisfying the frontier condition and compatible with a semialgebraic set $S \subset \R^n$ of arbitrary dimension.

Complexity results for each of the algorithms are presented, and the first two algorithms have been implemented in C, on top of `SACLIB`.

### Smooth stratification

In Chapter \@ref(sec:smooth-strat), we presented the algorithm described in Theorem 1 of @gv1995, which computes a smooth stratification of a semi-Pfaffian set $X \subset \R^n$, and then specialised it to the semialgebraic case, where the Oracle is not required, since it is always possible to check whether a semialgebraic set is empty. The main contribution of this section is a concrete algorithm and its implementation on top of `SACLIB`, which uses `QEPCAD-B` to determine whether candidate strata are empty. The implementation also ensures that each stratum is defined as a complete intersection within $X$. Note that each stratum may not be a complete intersection in $\R^n$. Indeed, $X$ itself may not be. Instead, we ensure that every stratum of codimension $k$, considered as a subset of $X$, requires exactly $k$ polynomial equations and, possibly, some inequalities, to define it.
We also presented complexity bounds, based on @gv1995 and a singly exponential algorithm for deciding emptiness due to @bpr98, including the bound on the number of strata, along with the maximum degree and number of polynomials required to define each stratum.

### Monotone CAD Algorithm

@bgv15, Theorem 3.20 gives a constructive proof that there exists a CAD, monotone with respect to a collection of bounded definable sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, each of which has dimension at most $2$, and satisfying the frontier condition. The main contribution of Chapters \@ref(sec:quasi-affine), \@ref(sec:monotone-cells) and \@ref(sec:frontier) is the design and implementation of an algorithm, based on @bgv15, Theorem 3.20, for constructing such a CAD. Following the construction due to @bgv15, the algorithm proceeds in three steps.

First, we constructed a CAD, compatible with each of $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ and such that each cell $C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map, following @bgv15 Lemma 3.19. This lemma first instructs us to consider $W$, the smooth $2$-dimensional locus of $V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$.
We achieved this by applying the smooth stratification algorithm, as presented in Section \@ref(sec:smooth-strat), and collecting the strata of codimension $n-2$.
We then observed that, according to @mccallum1998 Theorems 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, if McCallum's projection operator is used and there is only a finite number of blow-up points, smooth cells are obtained automatically.
@bgv15, Lemma 3.19 then tells us to construct a CAD which is compatible with all $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ and the critical
points of the projections of $W$ onto one- and $2$-dimensional coordinate subspaces.
We did this by ensuring that the CAD has constant sign on all polynomials defining the sets $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, along with some additional polynomials which arise from computing the determinants of Jacobi matrices defining either the (smooth) $2$-dimensional cells, or $2$-dimensional strata.
This completes the construction described in @bgv15, Lemma 3.19.
We presented this procedure as pseudo-code and obtained a complexity bound of
$\left(s (d+1)\right)^{\O(1)^{n}}$, which is slightly worse than classical CAD.

Next, Chapter \@ref(sec:monotone-cells) describes how some simple refinements of the quasi-affine CAD can be performed such that each cell $C \subset V_1 \cup \ldots \cup V_k$ is monotone. These refinements, described in @bgv15, Lemma 3.11, are of the kind $\{ x_1 = c \}, \{ x_1 > c \}, \{ x_1 < c \}$, where $c \in \R$.
Since the real roots of polynomials are always algebraic numbers, in the semialgebraic case, $c$ is always an element of $\A$. Due to @bgv15 Lemma 3.11, this type of refinement preserves the cylindrical structure along with existing monotone cells.
We found that these refinements were easy to perform on a CAD structure, simply by splitting $(1)$-cells in some induced decomposition and recomputing some of the sample points in the resulting new cells.
@bgv15, Lemma 3.18, defines these refinement points as those which ensure that the top and bottom of every $2$-dimensional cell contained in $V_1\cup \ldots V_k$ is the graph of a continuous, definable, monotone map.
We observed that the method of Lagrange Multipliers is ideal for finding these refinement points and the tools for applying this method are readily available in almost all computer algebra systems.
Indeed, this process relies on computing determinants of square matrices of polynomials and finding the first coordinate of their real roots.
Again, we presented pseudo-code and obtained a complexity result, which turned out to be the same as as that presented in Chapter \@ref(sec:quasi-affine).

Finally, Chapter \@ref(sec:frontier) explains how to refine the CAD so that it satisfies the frontier condition.
The first approach is a direct translation of the last part of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20. I.e., the frontiers of $2$-dimensional
cells are computed and then partitioned into points and monotone curve intervals.
We noted that the latter part of this construction,
partitioning a $1$-dimensional curve into monotone pieces -- is straightforward, as it has already been done when constructing monotone cells in the previous chapter.
However, we found that the task of computing the frontier of a semialgebraic set is not as easy. Lemma \@ref(lem:frontier) describes how to do this using quantifier elimination, and asserts that it has complexity singly exponential in the number of variables. However, the algorithm presented in [@bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21] is theoretical in nature and, in practice, we would have to resort to doubly exponential CAD to solve the QE problem.
Endeavouring to avoid this, we turned to @lazard10, who presents an algorithm for computing a CAD of $\R^3$ with
frontier condition. This algorithm relies on a CAD, containing only topologically regular cells, and having constant
sign on a set of polynomials to be given. Since this has already been done (in Chapters \@ref(sec:quasi-affine) and
\@ref(sec:monotone-cells)), Lazard's algorithm can be applied directly in dimension $3$.
Furthermore, we observed that, if $2$-dimensional
cells are contained in a sub-CAD of $\R^3$ above a $0$-dimensional cell, then Lazard's algorithm can, again, be applied directly to the sub-CAD.
The main contribution of Chapter \@ref(sec:frontier) is the observation that a similar situation to that described by Lazard exists in the special case of $2$-dimensional cells in a CAD of $\R^n$. We suggested an algorithm, heavily based on Lazard's method, to handle this situation.
We took this approach in the implementation, since it is more tractable than computing the frontier of every cell.
We again presented pseudo-code for the extension of Lazard's algorithm, along with performing a complexity analysis for both Gabrielov and Vorobjov's approach and Lazard's approach.
The complexity, for both approaches, is $\left(s (d+1)\right)^{\O(1)^{n}}$, which is the overall complexity of constructing the CAD with the properties from @bgv15, Theorem 3.20.

Overall, we have presented an algorithm (in Chapters \@ref(sec:quasi-affine) and \@ref(sec:monotone-cells)) which implements the result of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20. We found that this algorithm has complexity only slightly worse than classical CAD.
Chapter \@ref(sec:implementation-and-testing) is concerned with the implementation details of this algorithm, along with presenting some test cases which give an exposition of its three stages: quasi-affine, monotone and frontier condition.

### Novel algorithm for frontier condition

The final contribution is an algorithm, having *elementary* complexity, for constructing a CAD, compatible with a semialgebraic set of arbitrary dimension and satisfying the frontier condition.
We have removed the restriction imposed by @jhd20, as blow-ups are permitted, and we no longer require the rotation of coordinates proposed by @pianomovers1983 if blow-up points are present.
We found that it was not clear how this could be achieved using the usual induction -- on the ambient dimension -- so we took a novel approach
and performed a recursion on the lexicographical order of the cell's binary index $(i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$.
We gave a mathematical description and pseudo-code for this algorithm, along with a proof of correctness and complexity analyses.
We found, due to the number of steps in the recursion, that the complexity was triply exponential in the number of variables.
This work was presented in extended abstract form at CASC 2023.
However, the algorithm has not yet been implemented due to time constraints, but it is clear from the pseudo-code that it could be done using the tools we have been using throughout this thesis.

## Further work

Another fundamental construction in real algebraic geometry is triangulation -- which partitions a set into a collection of simplices (a simplicial complex).
The main result of @bgv15 relates to definable monotone families.
A family $\{ S_\delta \}_{\delta >0}$ is called monotone if sets $S_\delta$ are monotone
increasing as $\delta \to 0$, i.e., $S_\delta \subset S_\eta$ for all sufficiently small $\delta > \eta >0$.
It is often useful to approximate definable sets $K \subset \R^n$ by definable monotone families $S_{\delta}$. However, when blow-up points are present, these families can exibit a complex behaviour.
@bgv15 prove that there exists a triangulation of every definable set $K \subset \R^n$, having dimension at most $2$, such that in each $2$-simplex, the family belongs to one of five types, corresponding to one of five possible lexicographically monotone Boolean functions in two variables.
The proof of the classification in @bgv15 is non-constructive.
A natural progression of this project would be to design and implement an efficient
algorithm computing a triangulation for the input $(K, \{ S_\delta \})$.
An essential step in the computation of this triangulation is the construction of a CAD with monotone cells and satisfying the frontier condition. Furthermore, a linear change of coordinates, as suggested by, e.g., @pianomovers1983, is not allowed. Therefore, the monotone CAD algorithm developed in this thesis will be needed as a subroutine for this algorithm.

It is conjectured that this classification can be extended to $n$-dimensional sets $K$.
Another direction of research would be to prove this conjecture by generalising the results of @bgv15, and design an algorithm for computing such a triangulation in the case of sets with arbitrary dimension.
The first step would be to generalise the monotone CAD algorithm to sets with higher dimension.
It is not currently clear how this can be done, but one might want to start with sets of dimension $3$.
In @bgvII an algorithm-like procedure was proposed for constructing a decomposition of a $3$-dimensional set $K$
into topologically regular cylindrical cells which may not form an overall cylindrical decomposition, as cells may be cylindrical with respect to different orderings of variables.
The first step in solving this problem may be to implement this procedure or, possibly, strengthen it to obtain a decomposition which is cylindrical with respect to the given coordinate ordering.
The results in Section \@ref(sec:novel-frontier) make some strides towards the generalisation, allowing us to obtain the frontier condition in CADs compatible with sets of any dimension.

In addition, there are open questions, both theoretical and practical, relating to the novel algorithm for obtaining the frontier condition, presented in Section \@ref(sec:novel-frontier). For example, one might try to tighten the triply exponential complexity bound, by exploring whether it could be lowered, or by proving that the bound on CAD with frontier condition is higher than the doubly exponential bound obtained by @davenportHeintz1988. Practically speaking, the algorithm presented in Section \@ref(sec:novel-frontier) should be implemented, following the suggestions made in Section \@ref(sec:novel-frontier-fw), and tested with some examples of small dimension.

Finally, the implementation of the monotone CAD algorithm is a proof of concept and, as such, there is plenty of room for improvement where efficiency is concerned. For example, in order to compute the $x_1$-coordinates of the solutions to a system of multivariate polynomial equations, CAD projection is used. It is well-known that a doubly exponential number of polynomials may result. It may be more efficient to use other tools, e.g., Groebner bases, to compute these $x_1$-coordinates.
