# Smooth Stratification {#sec:smooth-strat}

Before turning out attention to cylindrical decompositions, we will present another useful algorithm for decompositng a semialgebraic set. A smooth stratification is a partition af a set into smooth manifolds. 
@whitney1965 proved that every complex, and real, analytic variety, i.e., an analytic set defined by a system of analytic equations, admits a smooth stratification. @thom1969 then extended this result by proving that every analytic set admits a smooth stratification. Later, @le2010 proved that every set in the far more general class of sets definable in an O-minimal structure admits a Whitney stratification. 

In this section, an algorithm due to @gv1995 (also summarised in @gv04, Section 6) for computing a basic weak stratification of an elementary semi-pfaffian set, such that each of the strata is "nicely defined" will be presented.

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 6.1]
Let $X \subset \R^n$ be a semianalytic set. $X$ is nonsingular and has dimension $k$ at a point $x \in X$ if there exist real analytic functions $$
h_1,\ldots,h_{n-k}
$$
defined in an open set $U$ containing $x_0$ such that
$$
dh_1(x_0) \ne 0 \land \cdots \land  dh_{n-k}(x_0) \ne 0
$$
and
$$
X \cap U = \{ x \in U \mid h_1(x) = 0 \land \cdots \land h_{n-k}(x) = 0 \}
$$
Let $Y \subset \R^n$ be a semi-pfaffian set.
$X \subset Y$ is called effectively nonsingular (of dimension $k$) if functions $h_1,\ldots,h_{n-k}$ belong to the same pfaffian chain as the functions defining $Y$.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 6.2]
A finite basic weak stratification of a semi-pfaffian set $X \subset \R^n$ is a partition of $X$ into a finite number of non-singular manifolds $X_k, 0 \le k \le n$ where each $X_k$ is effectively nonsingularand has codimension $k$.
:::

Note that this definition does not assume any other nice properties of the manifolds $X_k$. E.g., $\fr(X_k)$ need not be a union of other strata.

### Description of the algorithm

Since every semialgebraic set is a semi-Pfaffian set, this algorithm can be applied to the semialgebraic sets wwith almost no modifications. Furthermore, as emptiness of semialgebraic sets can be decided, e.g., using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition algorithm, an oracle will not be needed in this variation of the algorithm. 
The algorithm relies on computing partial derivatives of the functions defining the input set. In the semi-Pfaffian case, the number of partial derivatives needed to define all the strata is based on the format of the input set. As every polynomial has  a finite number of partial derivatives, this bound will simply be the dergee of the polynomial in the semialgebraic case.

We will need the following notation for patial derivatives and the partial differential operator. 

::: {.definition}
[@gv1995, Definition 2]
Let $f \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a polynomial and let $(m_1,\ldots,m_n) \subset \Z_{\ge 0}^n$ be a multi-index associated to one of its partial derivatives. 
I.e., we write
$$
\partial^{(m_1,\ldots,m_n)} =
\dfrac{\partial^{m_1} f}{\partial x_1} \cdots \dfrac{\partial^{m_n} f}{\partial x_n}.
$$
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv1995, Definition 2]
We define the partial differential operator $\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j} f$ (where the argument $f$ is a polynomial) as the determinant
$$
\det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
 & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
We write $\partial^m_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j}$ to mean the $m$-th iteration of $\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j}$.
:::

We now present the algorithm from @gv1995, Theorem 2.

$$\rm{Stratify}(k, {\cal G}, \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{g})$$

**Input:**

  - $0 \le k \le n$, an integer, representing codimension of strata to be constructed

  - ${\cal G} = ((i_n, \ldots, i_{k+1},j), f) \subset \Z_{\ge 0}^{n-k+1} \times \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a set of pairs of partial multi-indices and polynomials such that $\vert \cal{G} \vert = s$,

  - $\mathbf{h} = (h_k, \ldots,h_1, h_0) \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a list of polynomials such that $h_0 = 0$,

  - $\mathbf{i} = (i_k, \ldots, i_1,i_0) \subset \Z_{\ge 0}^k$ is a multi-index, $i_0 = 0$.

  - $\mathbf{g} = (g_1,\ldots,g_t) \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a set of polynomials.

**Output:**
$$
{\cal X} = (X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_0)
$$

  - $X_i, 0 \le i \le n$ is a (possibly empty) effectively nonsingular stratum of codimension $i$.

---

We proceed by induction on $i_k$.

- Base case: $i_k = n$, return $()$.

- Recursive case:

  - Initialise.
    
    - Set $$X_0 = X,$$
    - Let $${\cal X} := (\emptyset, \ldots, \emptyset)$$
    be the initial set of strata of codimension greater than $\le k+1$. 

  - Consider each multi-index $\mathbf{m} = (i_n,\ldots,i_{k+1},j) \subset \Z_{\ge 0}^{n-k} \times \{1,\ldots,s\}$ in ascending lexicographical order $\prec$, beginning with $$
  (0,\ldots,0,1,1).
  $$
  Index $(i_n,\ldots,i_1,j)$ has the property that
  $$
  (0,\ldots,1) \preceq (i_n,\ldots,i_1) \preceq M_j
  $$
  where $M_j = (\deg_n(f_j),\ldots,\deg_1(f_j))$ is the maximal index of each polynomial $f_j$ appearing in $\cal G$.

    - Let $(\mathbf{j}, h) \in {\cal G}$ such that $$
    \mathbf{j} = (0, \ldots, 0, i_{\ell} - 1, i_{\ell - 1}, \ldots, i_{k+1},j).
    $$

    - Compute
    $$
    s := \partial_{(h_1,\ldots,h_k), (i_1,\ldots,i_k), i_\ell} h
    $$

    - Define the sets
    $$
    Y := \{ \mathbf{x} \in X' \mid s(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \},
    $$
    (note $h(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in Y$) and
    $$
    U := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid h(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s(\mathbf{x} \ne 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0 , \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \},
    $$
    $U$ is a nonsingular subset of $\R^n$ having codimension $k+k$.

    - If $Y$ is an open subset of $U$, then $Y$ is nonsingular of codimension $k+1$.

      - Add $Y$ to the set of strata of codimension $k+1$. Set
      $$X_{k+1} := X_{k+1} \cup Y.$$

      - and add polynomial $s$ to $\cal G$. Set
      $$
      {\cal G} := {\cal G} \cup \{ ((i_\ell,\ldots,i_1,j), s) \}
      $$

    - Otherwise, $Y$ is not smooth, so we proceed recursively.
    
    - Compute $$
    {\cal X'} := {\rm Stratify}(k+1, {\cal G}', (s,h_k,\ldots,h_1,0), (i_\ell,i_k,\ldots,i_1,0), \mathbf{g})
    $$
    where ${\cal G}' = \{ ((0,\ldots,0,i), g) \in \Z_{\ge 0}^{n-\ell + 1} \mid g \in {\cal G} \}$ such that partial index $(0,\ldots,0,i-1)$ in $\cal G'$ immediately preceeds $(0,\ldots,0,i)$ if index $(i_n,\ldots,i_k,j)$ immediately preceeds $(i'_n,\ldots,i'_k,j')$ in $\cal G$. In other words, elemens of $\cal G'$ respect the same lexicographical order on indices as in $\cal G$. 

      - Add the new strata from $\cal X'$ to $\cal X$. Set
      $$
      {\cal X} = (X_{k+1}, X_k \cup X'_k, \ldots, X_0 \cup X'_0)
      $$
      where ${\cal X'} = (X'_k, \ldots, X'_0)$.

    - Update $X'$ by removing the points from $X$ where $s$ does not vanish. Set
    $$
    X = X', X' := \{ \mathbf{x} \in X \mid s(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \},
    $$
    which is a proper (possibly empty) subset of $X$.

    - If $X' \ne \emptyset$, proceed to the next index with respect to the lexicographical order $\prec$.

  - Once all indices have been exhausted, return
  $$
  {\cal X} = (X_{k+1},\ldots,X_0)
  $$
  If $k = 0$, there is a special case. If every derivatcive $s$ vanishes identically on the input set, then the entire set is smooth. Return
  $$
  {\cal X} := (\emptyset, \ldots, \emptyset, X_0)
  $$
  where $X_0 = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, f_s(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}$.

---

The algorithm is then called as follows. 
Let 
$$
X = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \cdots, f_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \cdots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \} \subset \R^n
$$
be a semialgebraic set with each polynomial $f_i, g_j \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n], 1\le i \le s, 1 \le j \le t$. 
We first apply some pre-processing to the polynomial equations defining $X$ to initialise their indices. Let 
$$
{\cal G} := \{ (0,\ldots,0,j), f_j) \mid 1 \le j \le s \}
$$
and compute
$$
\cal{X} := {\rm Stratify}(0, {\cal G}, (0), (0), (g_1,\ldots,g_t)).
$$
We thus obtain the set of strata ${\cal X} = (X_n,\ldots,X_0$. If $X_0 = \emptyset$, then each $X_i$ is a smooth subset of $X$ of codimension $i$. Otherwise, $X_0$ coincides with $X$. Note, in the latter case, that $X_0$ provides no information on the dimension of $X$. 


### Implementation details

The algorithm may be implemented as above, but a couple of shortcuts can be taken to simplify the code and make the algorithm work slightly more efficiently.
First, suppose that we are considering index
$$
(0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,\ldots,i_{k+1},i_k,\ldots,i_1,i_0).$$
Partial differentials with index lexicographically less than $(i_{k+1},0,\ldots,0)$ have been computed on a previous round of induction and were passed in the argument $\mathbf{G}$.
Furthermore, the function $h_k$, having index
$$
(0,\ldots,0,i_{\ell -1},\ldots,i_0)
$$
has already been computed, so it can be taken directly from the list $\mathbf{G}$.
In fact, there is a convenient way to find the function with index $(0,\ldots,0,i_\ell - 1, \ldots,i_1,i_0)$. Let us first illustrate this with an example. Let $M = (1,2,2)$ and consider the lexicographically ordered list of indices
$$
\begin{matrix}
L_1 :=\ &  (0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,2),&(0,1,0),&(0,1,1),&(0,1,2),&(1,0,0),&(1,0,1)&\ldots\\
L_2 := \ & & (0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,2),&(0,0,0),&(0,0,1)&\ldots.\\
\end{matrix}
$$
Observe that for indices $(0,0,1)$, $(0,1,0)$ and $(1,0,0)$ in $L_1$, the corresponding element in $L_2$ is $(0,0,0)$ and the corresponding elements for subsequent indices are those in the lexicographical order.
I.e., we see that the index of $h_k$ "chases after" the index of $s_k$, resetting each time $\ell$ is incremented.
More precisely, when $\ell = 1$ and $s_1$ has index $(0,\ldots,0,i),i>0$, $h_1 has index $(0,\ldots,0,i-1)$. I.e., our initial "chase index" is the previous element in the list. When $\ell$ is incremented, we need to return to the first element in the list, $(0,\ldots,0)$ and proceed lexicographically through the indices until $\ell$ is incremented again, at which point we return to the beginning of the list. This gives us the property that when $h_k$ has index $(0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,i_{\ell-1},\ldots,i_1)$, $h_1$ will have index $(0,\ldots,0,i_\ell - 1,i_{\ell - 1},\ldots,i_1)$ while only requiring two very basic list operations: get the next element and return to the beginning. In the example, we considered only one polynomial. To extend to multiple polynomials, since each will have a different $M$, we need to keep a separate "chase list" for each one.

Since the program has been implemented in QEPCAD, which utilises linked lists, it was important to ensure that appending to the end of the list is as efficient as possible. To avoid $O(n)$ insertion complexity, we keep a pointer to the last-but-one element in the list, i.e., suppose $L = (a_1,(\ldots,(a_{r-1},(a_r,(\rm{NIL})))\ldots)$ then $L_{\rm{append}} = (a_{r-1},(a_r,(\rm{NIL})))$. Then, if we wish to append $b$ to the end of $L$, we simply need to set the reductum of $L_{\rm{append}}$ to $(a_r,(b,(NIL)))$.

Secondly, observe that only the last row and last column in the $(k\times k$-matrix for the partial differential operater
$$
\partial_{\mathbf{h},\mathbf{i},j} f = \det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
 & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
depend on $f$ and $i$. As a result, we can re-use the $(k-1\times k-1)$-matrix consisting of the first $k-1$ rows and columns of $\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j} f$.
In the implementation, we can receive as an argument, from the previous round of induction, this $(k-1\times k-1)$-matrix which will be used throughout that round. We still, however, need to compute the determinant for every new $s_k$.

We will now present, from [@gv1995, Theorem 1], the proof that this algorithm does indeed produce smooth strata and also that it terminates.

This algorithm is doubly exponential in the number of variables. For the polynomial case, the complexity is
$$
s^n (d+1)^{2^{O(n)}}
$$
where $s$ is the number of polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_s$, $d$ is their degree and $n$ is the number of variables. [@gv1995, Section 4]

### Worked example

We illustrate the smooth stratification algorithm with a worked example. Consider
$$
\{ z = 0, x^2-y^2=0 \} \subset \R^3.
$$
Note that the algorithm imposes an order on polynomials. In this case, $h_1 = z$ will be considered first. The algorithm proceeds as follows

$k=1,G_{1}=\left(z,x^{2}-y^{2}\right),J=\begin{pmatrix}\partial h_{1}/\partial y_{1}\end{pmatrix}$
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
i = 1 & M=(0,0,1,1), & h_{1}=z, & s_{1}=0, & \text{skip}\\
i = 1 & M=(0,0,1,2), & h_{1}=x^{2}-y^{2} & s_{1}=2x, & Y_{1}:=\left\{ z=0,x^{2}-y^{2}=0,2x\ne0\right\} =X\setminus\left\{ x=0\right\} \\
&  &  &  & U_{1}:=\left\{ x^{2}-y^{2}=0,2x\ne0\right\} 
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
$Y_{1}$ is not an open subset of $U_{1}$, recurse.

$k=2,G_{2}=\left(z,x^{2}-y^{2},2x\right),J=\begin{pmatrix}2x & \partial s_{1}/\partial y_{2}\\
\partial h_{2}/\partial x & \partial h_{2}/\partial y_{2}
\end{pmatrix}$
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
i = 2 & M=(0,1,1), & h_{2}=z, & s_{2}=\det\begin{pmatrix}2x & 2y\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}=0, & \text{skip}\\
i = 2 & M=(0,1,2), & h_{2}=x^{2}-y^{2} & s_{2}=\det\begin{pmatrix}2x & 2y\\
2x & 2y
\end{pmatrix}=0 & \text{skip}\\
i = 2 & M=(0,1,3) & h_{2}=2x & \det\begin{pmatrix}2x & 2y\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}=0 & \text{skip}\\
i = 3 & M=(1,0,1) & h_{1}=z & \det\begin{pmatrix}2x & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}=2x & Y_{2}:=Y_{1}\cap\left\{ 2x\ne0\right\} =Y_{2}\\
&  &  &  & U_{2}:=\left\{ z=0,2x\ne0\right\} 
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}
$Y_{2}$ is an open subset of $U_{2}$, hence $Y_{2}=Y_{1}$ is a smooth subset of codimension $2$. Set $X_{2} = Y_{2} = Y_{1}. Return to round $k=1$, Recall that the last index considered in step $k=1$ was $(0,0,1,2)$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
i = 1 & M=(0,0,1,2), & h_{1}=x^{2}-y^{2} & s_{1}=2x, & Y_{1}:=\left\{ z=0,x^{2}-y^{2}=0,2x\ne0\right\} =X\setminus\left\{ x=0\right\} \\
\vdots &  &  & \text{skip until next nenzero partial derivative}\\
i = 2 & M=(0,1,0,2) & h_{1}=x^{2}-y^{2} & h_{1}=2y & Y_{1}:=\left\{ z=0,x^{2}-y^{2}=0,2x=0,2y\ne0\right\} =\emptyset\\
\vdots &  &  & \text{the rest of the partial derivatives do not exist}
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}

At the end of round $k=1$, $X_{1}=\emptyset$ and we are left with 
$$
X':=\left\{ z=0,x^{2}+y^{2}=0,2x=0,2y=0\right\}=(0,0,0),
$$ a single point. $X_{0}$ is set to $X'$ and the algorithm terminates.

Note that this weak stratification does not impose any conditions on the boundaries of strata. In particular, the boundary of a stratum need not be a union of strata.
