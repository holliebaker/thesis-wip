# Smooth Stratification {#sec:smooth-strat}

Before turning our attention to cylindrical decompositions, we will present another useful algorithm for decomposing a semialgebraic set. A smooth stratification is a partition of a set into smooth manifolds. 

In 1957, @whitney1992 proved that every algebraic variety can be partitioned into a finite set of smooth manifolds, each of which is a semialgebraic set. 
Lojasiewicz extended this result by proving that every real semianalytic set admits a smooth stratification [@lojasiewicz1964, @lojasiewicz1964]. However, the proof was nonconstructive and did not provide any information on the class of functions defining the strata. 
As part of his Complement Theorem, @gabrielov1996 proved that the strata of a semianalytic set can be defined by functions belonging to the smallest extensions of a family of functions defining the set which is closed under addition, multiplication and taking partial derivatives. One such class of functions is the Pfaffian functions. 
@gv1995 present an algorithm for computing a smooth stratification of a semi-pfaffian et, along with an estimate of its complexity and bounds on the formats of the strata it produces. This algorithm (also summarised in @gv04, Section 6) will be presented.

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 6.1]
Let $X \subset \R^n$ be a semianalytic set. $X$ is nonsingular and has codimension $k$ at a point $x \in X$ if there exist real analytic functions $$
h_1,\ldots,h_{n-k}
$$
defined in an open set $U$ containing $x_0$ such that
$$
dh_1(x_0) \ne 0 \land \cdots \land  dh_{n-k}(x_0) \ne 0
$$
and
$$
X \cap U = \{ x \in U \mid h_1(x) = 0 \land \cdots \land h_{n-k}(x) = 0 \}
$$
Let $Y \subset \R^n$ be a semi-pfaffian set.
$X \subset Y$ is called effectively nonsingular (of dimension $k$) if functions $h_1,\ldots,h_{n-k}$ belong to the same pfaffian chain as the functions defining $Y$.
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv04, Definition 6.2]
A finite basic weak stratification of a semi-pfaffian set $X \subset \R^n$ is a partition of $X$ into a finite number of non-singular manifolds $X_k, 0 \le k \le n$ where each $X_k$ is effectively nonsingularand has codimension $k$.
:::

Note that this definition does not assume any other desirable properties of the manifolds $X_k$. E.g., the closure of a stratum may not be a union of strata. In addition, the Whitney conditions may not be satisfied. 

### Description of the algorithm

Since every semialgebraic set is a semi-Pfaffian set, this algorithm can be applied to the semialgebraic sets with almost no modifications. Since each stratum is defined by sign conditions on partial derivatives of input functions, it is clear that if the input set is semialgebraic, then each stratum will be semialgebraic, too.  Furthermore, as emptiness of semialgebraic sets can be decided, e.g., using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition algorithm, an oracle will not be needed in this variation of the algorithm. 
The algorithm relies on computing partial derivatives of the functions defining the input set. In the semi-Pfaffian case, the number of partial derivatives needed to define all the strata is based on the format of the input set. As every polynomial has  a finite number of partial derivatives, this bound will simply be the dergee of the polynomial in the semialgebraic case.

We will need the following notation for partial derivatives and the partial differential operator defined by @gv1995. 

::: {.definition}
[@gv1995, Definition 2]
Let $f \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a polynomial and let $(m_1,\ldots,m_n) \subset \Z_{\ge 0}^n$ be a multi-index associated to one of its partial derivatives. 
I.e., we write
$$
\partial^{(m_1,\ldots,m_n)} =
\dfrac{\partial^{m_1} f}{\partial x_1} \cdots \dfrac{\partial^{m_n} f}{\partial x_n}.
$$
:::

::: {.definition}
[@gv1995, Definition 2]
We define the partial differential operator $\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j} f$ (where the argument $f$ is a polynomial) as the determinant
$$
\det\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
 & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
We write $\partial^m_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j}$ to mean the $m$-th iteration of $\partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j}$.
:::

We can now present the algorithm from @gv1995, Theorem 2.

Let $$
X = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0,\ldots,f_s(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}.
$$

$${\cal X} := \rm{Stratify}(k, F, \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, G)$$

**Input:**

  - $0 \le k \le n$,
  - $F = (f_1,\ldots,f_s) \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,z_n]$ is a list of polynomials,
  - $\mathbf{h} = (h_k, \ldots,h_1, h_0) \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $h_0 = 0$,
  - $\mathbf{i} = (i_k, \ldots, i_1,i_0) \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ such that $i_0 = 0$,
  - $G = \{g_1,\ldots,g_t\} \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.

**Output:**
$$
{\cal X} = (X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_n)
$$
$X_i, k+1 \le i \le n$ is a possibly empty, effectively nonsingular stratum of codimension $i$. 
Note that ${\cal X}_{n+1} = ()$.

---

Proceed by induction on $i_k$.

- Base case: $i_k = n$. 
  
  - Return ${\cal X}_{x+1} = (\emptyset, \ldots, \emptyset)$.

- Otherwise

  - Initialise

    - $X' := X = \{ f_1 = 0,\ldots,f_s = 0, g_1 > 0, \ldots, g_t > 0 \}$,

    - ${\cal F} := \{ ((0,\ldots,0,1), f_1), \ldots, ((0,\ldots,0,s), f_s) \}$
      (the set of input polynomials equipped with initial indices),

    - $X_{k+1} = \emptyset$ be the initial set of strata of codimension $k+1$. 

  - For indices $\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j} \in \Z_{\ge 0}^n$, 
    - let $\mathbf{i} \prec \mathbf{j}$ mean that $\mathbf{i}$ is lexicographically less than $\mathbf{j}$
    - and $\mathbf{i} \preceq \mathbf{j}$ denote $\mathbf{i}\prec \mathbf{j}$ or $\mathbf{i} = \mathbf{j}$.

  - We will iterate over each index $\mathbf{m} = (i_n,\ldots,i_{k+1},j) \in \Z_{\ge 0}^{n-k+1}$ in ascending lexicographical order, beginning with $(0,\ldots,0,1)$. 

  - Partial derivatives $\partial^{(0,\ldots,0,i_{k+1},\ldots,i_n)}$ of functions $f$ in ${\cal F}$ will be computed.

  - For each $f\in {\cal F}$, maximal index $$M := (\deg_n(f), \ldots, \deg_{k+1}(f)).$$

  - Each index $(i_n,\ldots,i_{k+1},j)$ has the property that
  $$
  (0,\ldots,1) \preceq (i_n,\ldots,i_{k+1}) \preceq M_j.
  $$

    - Let $\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,\ldots,i_{k+1},j)$ be one of these indices and define
    $$
    \mathbf{j} = (0, \ldots, 0, i_{\ell} - 1, i_{\ell - 1}, \ldots, i_{k+1},j).
    $$

    - Let
    $$
    s_{k+1} := \partial_{(h_{1,},\ldots,,h_{k}),(i_{1},\ldots,i_{k}),\ell}^{i_{\ell}}\ldots\partial_{(h_{1,},\ldots,,h_{k}),(i_{1},\ldots,i_{k}),i_{k}+1}^{i_{i}+1}f_{j}
    $$
    where $f_j$ is the polynomial in $\cal F$ with index $(0,\ldots,0,j)$, i.e., the $j$-th input polynomial. 

    - In practice, let $h_{k+1}$ be the polynomial in $\cal F$ with index $\mathbf{i}$ and compute
    $$
    s_{k+1} := \partial_{(h_1,\ldots,h_k), (i_1,\ldots,i_k), i_\ell} h_{k+1}.
    $$

    - Define the sets

      - $Y_{k+1} := \{ \mathbf{x} \in X' \mid s_{k+1}(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}$ and

      - $U_{k+1} := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid h_{k+1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s_{k+1}(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0 , \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}$.

      - Note 
  
        - Clearly $Y_{k+1} \subset X' and $Y_{k+1} \subset U_{k+1}$
        - $h_{k+1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in Y_{k+1}$.
        - $U_{k+1}$ is a nonsingular subset of $\R^n$ having codimension $k+1$.

      - If $Y_{k+1}$ is an open subset of $U_{k+1}$, then $Y_{k+1}$ is smooth and has codimension $k+1$.

        - Let $X_{k+1} := X_{k+1} \cup Y$,

      - Otherwise, proceed by induction.

          - Compute
          $$(X^{\mathbf{m}}_{k+2},\ldots,X^{\mathbf{m}}_n) := {\rm Stratify}(k+1, F, (s,:\mathbf{h}), (i_\ell:\mathbf{i}), G)$$
          where $x:L$ denotes the `cons` operator. I.g., add $x$ to the beginning of list $L$.

      - Let $\rm{Empty}(X,s)$ be a subroutine returning *true* if $s \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is identically zero on the set $X \subset \R^n$.

      - If $\rm{Empty}(X,s)$, we are finished. 

        - Return 
        $${\cal X}_{k+1} = (X_{k+1}, X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_n).$$
        where $X_i, k+2\le i \le n$ is the union of all strata $X^{\mathbf{m}}_i$ computed in the recursive calls.

      - Otherwise,

        - Let

          - $X' := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid s(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \}$,

          - ${\cal F} := {\cal F} \cup \{ ((0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,\ldots,i_{k+1},j), s) \}$,

        - $F := F:s$ (i.e., append $s$ to the end of list $F$).

      - Then proceed to the index immediately after $\mathbf{m}$ with respect to $\prec$.
  
      - The algorithm terminates when maximal index $M_j$ for every polynomial $f_j \in F$ has been considered.

---

To call this algorithm on a semialgebraic set $X \subset \R^n$ defined by equations $F \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $G \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,z_n]$, compute 
$$
{\cal X}' = {\rm Stratify}(0, F, (0), (0), G).
$$
to obtain a set of strata ${\cal X'} = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$. 
If all $X_i = \emptyset, 1 \le i \le k$, then we can conclude that every partial derivative vanishes identically on $X$. Hence, $X$ is a smooth subset of $\R^n$ and we let $X_0 = X$. 
Otherwise, let $X_0 = \emptyset$ so that ${\cal X} = (\emptyset, X_1,\ldots,x_n)$ where each $X_i,1\le i \le n$ is a smooth subset of $X$ of codimension $i$, such that each $X_i,X_j,i\ne j$ is pairwise disjoint and $X_1\cup \ldots \cup X_n = X$.
Note, in the case that $X_0 = X$, the smooth stratification algorithm provides no information about the dimension of $X$. 

### Implementation details

The algorithm employs two subroutines, which were presented in the description as "black-box functions".
The first of these is a subroutine which determines whether $Y_K$ is an open subset of $U_k$.
We can formulate this question as a quantifier elimination problem. $Y_k$ is an open subset of $U_k$ if
$$
\forall \mathbf{x} \in Y_k \forall \varepsilon > 0 \> \exists \mathbf{y} \in Y_k \mid \mathbf{y} \in U_k, \Vert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \Vert < \varepsilon
$$
is true. Here we use the definition of open set using open balls. We must intersect the open ball with $U_k$ because $Y_k$ may be open in $U_k$ but not in $\R^n$. 
An alternative method, as described in @gv1995, Theorem 1, is to check whether every derivative computed at step $k+1$ vanishes on the set
$$
U_k \cap \{ x_i = \tt{const} \mid i < i_1 \}.
$$
This reduces to the emptiness check again.

The second of these is $\rm{Empty}(S)$, where $S \subset \R^n$ is a semialgebraic set represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula which is a conjunction of polynomial equations, inequations and inequalities. Note that an inequation $\{ f(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}$ can b e rewritten as $\{ f(\mathbf{x}) < 0 \lor f(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}$, so it is possible to represent $S$ by two systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, or a Boolean formula containing the conjunction above. This permits various methods for checking emptiness. We may write $\rm{Empty}(S)$ as a quantifier elimination problem
$$
\exists \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = \ldots = f_s(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s_1(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, \ldots, s_k(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_t(\mathbf{x}) > 0.
$$
This problem can be decided using the singly-exponential quantifier elimination algorithm from @bpr2006, Algorithm 14.21. However, this algorithm is theoretical and, in practice, we can use quantifier elimination by CAD to decide whether this set is empty. 

The algorithm may be implemented as above, but with some small tweaks to simplify the code and make the algorithm work slightly more efficiently.  
First, observe that not all derivatives are needed to define the candidate strata $Y_k$. One obvious situation is when a derivative $s_k$ turns out to be a nonzero constant $c \in \A$. 
In the formula for $Y_k$, the inequation $c \ne 0$ will appear, which is obviously true. Since $X' \supset Y_k$ was assumed to be non-empty, we can immediately conclude that $Y_k$ is non-empty and equal to $X'$. No further derivatives at step $k$ need to be considered, since $X' \setminus Y_1 = \emptyset$. 
A similar situation may arise, even with nonconstant functions $s_k$. For example, for the input set 
$$X := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^2 \mid x^2 y^2 = 0 \},$$
the derivative for index $(0,1)$ is $\partial (x^2 y^2) / \partial x_1 = 2x y^2$, which is equal to zero at every point of $X$. 
By discarding these redundant functions, we minimise the number of polynomials defining sets in the emptiness check. Note that we have to keep track of every derivative computed, even the redundant ones, so that we can find the function $h_k$ such that $s_k = \partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, j} h_1$.

Now consider the operation of finding the derivative with index $(0,\ldots,i_\ell - 1,i_{\ell - 1}, \ldots, i_{k+1},j)$. The following observation allows us to quickly find this polynomial, avoiding a search in $\cal G$ or unneccesary recomputation of derivatives. 
Suppose we are considering index
$$
\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,i_{\ell - 1},\ldots,i_{k+1},j)$$
and want to find the derivative with index 
$$
\mathbf{j} = (0,\ldots,0,i_\ell - 1,i_{\ell - 1},\ldots,i_{k+1},j).$$
The set $\cal G$ includes polynomials computed in previous rounds of induction and those with index $\mathbf{i} \prec \mathbf{m}$, since we proceed in ascending lexicographical order. Hence $\cal G$ contains the derivative with index $\mathbf{j}$. 
There is a convenient way to find this derivative. 
Let us first illustrate the process with an example. Let $f_j \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_3]$ with $M_j = (1,2,2)$ and consider the lexicographically ordered list of indices
$$
\begin{matrix}
L_1 :=\ &  (0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,2),&(0,1,0),&(0,1,1),&(0,1,2),&(1,0,0),&(1,0,1)&\ldots\\
L_2 := \ & & (0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,0),&(0,0,1),&(0,0,2),&(0,0,0),&(0,0,1)&\ldots.\\
\end{matrix}
$$
Observe that for indices of the kind $(0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)$ in $L_1$, the corresponding element of $L_2$ is $(0,\ldots,0)$. For an arbitrary index $(0,\ldots,0,i_\ell,\ldots,i_1)$ in $L_1$ which appears $k$ elements after $(0,\ldots,0,i_\ell = 1,0,\ldots,0)$, the corresponding element in $L_2$ appears $k$ elements after $(0,\ldots,0)$.
From this, we can introduce an "index chasing" method as follows. Let ${\cal G}_j$ be the (ordered) list of derivatives of polynomial $f_j$. For each $\mathbf{m}$, we keep a pointer, ${\cal G}'_j$, to the element in ${\cal G}_j$ with index $\mathbf{j}$. 

- Initialise ${\cal G}_j = ((0,\ldots,0),f_j)$. For $\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,1)$, set ${\cal G}'_j = {\cal G}_j$.
- Now suppose that ${\cal G}_j$ contains all polynomials with index $\prec \mathbf{m}$.
  - If $\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)$, then $\mathbf{j} = (0,\ldots,0)$ and we set ${\cal G}'_j$ to the head of ${\cal G}_j$. 
  - Otherwise, let ${\cal G}'_j$ be the tail of ${\cal G}'_j$.

The "index chasing" method works efficiently in SACLIB, which uses linked lists. However, we do need to append new derivatives to the end of ${\cal G}_j$, which takes $O(n)$ steps. 
To avoid this, we keep a pointer to the last-but-one element in the list, i.e., suppose $G_j = (a_1,(\ldots,(a_{r-1},(a_r,(\rm{NIL})))\ldots)$ then $G_{j,\rm{append}} = (a_{r-1},(a_r,(\rm{NIL})))$. Then, if we wish to append $b$ to the end of $G_j$, we simply need to set the tail of $G_{j,\rm{append}}$ to $(a_r,(b,(NIL)))$.

We can also optimise the construction of the matrix associated to the partial differential operator $\partial_{\mathbf{h},\mathbf{i},j} f$. In this matrix,
$$
\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
 & \vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial h_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\\
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{1}}} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i_{k}}} & \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{pmatrix},
$$
only the last row depends on $f$ and only the last column depends on $j$. Thus, we can save the $(k\times k)$-submatrix consisting of the first $k$ rows and columns and only append the new row and column. This matrix can be passed as an argument to ${\rm Stratify}(k,\ldots)$, with the matrix for $k=0$ being empty (i.e., $\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{i} = ()$ in the partial differential operator).

### Complexity

In the polynomial case, the complexity is
$$
s^n (d+1)^{2^{O(n)}}
$$
where $s$ is the number of polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_s$, $d$ is their degree and $n$ is the number of variables. [@gv1995, Section 4]

### Worked example

We illustrate the smooth stratification algorithm with a worked example in $\R^3$. Consider
$$
\{ x_3 = 0, x_1^2-x_2^2=0 \} \subset \R^3.
$$
Note that the algorithm imposes an order on polynomials. Here we take $f_1 := z$ and $f_2 = x^2 - y^2$, wiht $f_1$ and $f_2$ being assigned indices $(0,0,0,1)$ and $(0,0,0,2)$ respectively. 
The algorithm proceeds as follows

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

### Determining the codimension and basic formula for each stratum

@gv1995, Theorem 2 assert that each stratum of codimension $k$ can be represented by a conjunction containing $k$ equations. I.e., each stratum is basic. A naive implementation of the procedure leads to a non-basic representation as shown in the following example

::: {.example}
Consider the semialgebraic set 
$$
S := \{ (x_1,x_2) \in \R^2 \mid x_1 x_2 = 0 \}
$$
Apply the algorithm.
\begin{align*}
k=0,X':=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid f_{1}:=x_{1}x_{2}=0\right\} \\\left(0,1,1\right)h_{1}=&f_{1}=x_{1}x_{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{1}=&x_{2}\\Y_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid y\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^2\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,x_{2}\ne0\right\} \\&\text{Proceed by induction}\\k=1,h_{1}=f_{1},i_{1}=1,X'':=&Y_{1},F_{1}=\left\{ f_{1}\right\} \\\left(1,1\right),h_{2}=&f_{1}\\s_{2}=&\begin{pmatrix}\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{1} & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}\\
\partial f_{2}/\partial x_{1} & \partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}
\end{pmatrix}=0\\&\text{since both columns are equal.}\\\text{Return. }Y_{1}&\text{ is smooth.}\\
\end{align*}

Observe that the formula for $Y_1$ contains one equation, $h_1 = f_1$. Hence $Y_1$ is a smooth stratum in basic representation and we can conclude that it has codimension $1$. 

For the next nonzero derivative, with index $(1,0,1)$, we get
\begin{align*}
k=0,X':=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,y=0\right\} \\\left(1,0,1\right)\ h_{1}=&f_{1}=x_{1}x_{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}=&x_{1}\\Y_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid x_{1}\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,x_{1}\ne0\right\} \\&\text{Proceed by indection.}\\k=1,h_{1}=f_{1},i_{1}=2,X'':=&Y_{1}\ldots\\&\text{No partial derivatives can be computed.}\\\text{Return. }Y_{1}&\text{ is smooth.}
\end{align*}

Notice that the inductive step returns immediately. This is because $i_1=2$, so it is not passible to take further partial derivatives with respect to $j > i_1$. In the formula for
$$
Y_1 := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^2 \mid f_1 := x_1 x_2 = 0, h_1 := x_2 = 0, x_1 \ne 0 \},
$$
two different equations, $f_1$ and $h_1$ appear. However, $Y_1$ is not in basic representation. Indeed, the equation $f_1=0$ is redundent, since $f_1$ is equal to zero for all points at which $h_1$ is equal to zero. Thus $f_1$ can be discarded, and we see that only one equation, $h_1$, is required to represent $Y_1$ in basic form. We can conclude that $Y_1$ is smooth and has codimension $1$. 

Finally, consider the derivative with index $(1,1,1)$.
\begin{align*}
k=0,X':=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{1}x_{2}=0,x_{2}=0,x_{1}=0\right\} \\\left(1,1,1\right)\ h_{1}=&s_{1}^{\left(0,1,1\right)}=x_{2}\\s_{1}=\partial f_{1}/\partial x_{2}=&1\\Y_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in X'\mid1\ne0\right\} \\U_{1}:=&\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x_{2}=0,1\ne0\right\}
\end{align*}
Again, the inductive step returns immediately because $i_1=2$, but this time we can see that $Y_1$ is not an open subset of $U_1$. As mentioned above, the algorithm is unable to determine this without solving a quantifier elimination problem. Instead, we may be able to determine the codimension by looking at the basic representation of $$
Y_1 := \{ (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1 x_2 = 0, x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0 \}.
$$
(Note that the constraint $1 \ne 0$ is dropped since it is trivial and adds no information.)
We see that three equations appear in the definition of $Y_1$, but the first one, $f_1 := x_1 y_2$ is redundant again. Thus, the two equations $x_2 = 0, x_1 = 0$ define $Y_1$ and we can conclude that $Y_1$ is smooth and has codimension $2$. 
:::

This example shows two things. Firstly, not all functions are required to represent the smooth stratum and secondly $k$, the current step of induction, gives a lower bound on the codimension of strata. 
@gv1995, Theorem 1 states that
$$
\det\begin{pmatrix}\partial h_{1}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial h_{1}/\partial x_{i_{k}}\\
\vdots &  & \vdots\\
\partial h_{k}/\partial x_{i_{1}} & \ldots & \partial h_{k}/\partial x_{i_{k}}
\end{pmatrix}\ne0
$$
at every point of a stratum $X_k$ of codimension $k$ which includes the functions $h_1,\ldots,h_k$ in its definition.
As we saw in the example, other functions vanish at every point of $X_k$. We need to find the "basic" set of $k$ functions needed to define $X_k$. 

#### Discarding redundant equations

Let $F \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a set of polynomials, indexed by $(m_{i_1},\ldots,m_1,j)$ and, for $\mathbf{m} = (0,\ldots,0,m_\ell,\ldots,m_1,j),\ell > i_1$ let
$$
s^{m_n,\ldots,i_1,j}_k = \partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, n}^m_n \partial_{\mathbf{h}, \mathbf{i}, i_1 + 1}^m_{i_1 + 1} f 
$$
be the partial derivative computed at index $\mathbf{m}$, where $f \in F$ has index $(m_1,\ldots,m_1,j)$ be one of the partial derivatives computed during the algorithm. 
Denote by $G$ the set of derivatives with index lexicographically less than $\mathbf{m}$. $Y_k \subset Y_{k-1}$ is defined such that every function in $G$ is equal to zero while the function $h^{\mathbf{m}}_k$ is not. 
Define the smooth manifold
$$
U_k := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid h_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, h_{k-1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, h_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s^{\mathbf{m}}_k(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}.
$$
of codimension $k$, where the function $h_k := s^{(0,\ldots,0,m_\ell - 1,m_{\ell - 1},\ldots,m_1,j)}_k$. According to @gv1995, Theorem 2, $Y_k$ is smooth and has codimension $k$ if it is an open subset of $U_k$. In this case, only $k$ of the polynomials will be needed to define $Y_k$. Note that inequations $s_1,\ldots,s_{k-1}$ which appear in the definition of $Y_{k-1} \supset Y_k$ should also be taken into account. 
Begin with a set
$$
Y' := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid h_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, h_{k-1}(\mathbf{x}) = 0, s_1(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, \ldots, s_(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0, s_k(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \} \subset Y_k.
$$
Consider each function $g \in G$ in reverse lexicographical order. If $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ at every point $\mathbf{x} \in Y'$ then it is redundant and should be discarded. Otherwise, $g$ should be included in the defining equations for $Y_k$. Since $Y_k$ has codimension $k$, and $Y'$ is already an open, basic set of codimension $k-1$, only one more polynomial should be needed. 
If $Y_k$ is not an open subset of $U_k$, then more polynomials will be required to define it, and the number of polynomials gives the codimension.

A polynomial $g \in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is redundant in the definition of the semialgeabric set $S \subset \R^n$ if the following formula is true
$$
\exists x_1,\ldots,x_n,a \in \R^{n+1} \mid (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in S, a \ne 0, g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = a.
$$
This problem can also be formulated using the emptiness check. $g$ is redundant in the definition of $S$ if the semialgebraic set
$$
\{ \mathbf{x} \in S \mid g(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0 \}
$$
is non-empty. 

- TODO do we also need to check that the determinant of the matrix (minors?) is nonzero.

### From Elementary Algebraic sets to generic Semialgebraic sets {#sec:strat-semialgebraic}

@gv1995, Corollary 1 asserts that the algorithm can be applied to arbitrary semi-pfaffian sets and, therefore, without modification, to arbitrary semialgebraic sets.
Let $S \subset \R^n$ be a semialgebrac set represented by a quantifier-free Boolean formula containing polynomials
$$
f_1,\ldots,f_s.
$$
Consider each "sign set"
$$
S_{( \ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s )} := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) \ast_1 0, \ldots, f_s(\mathbf{x}) \ast_s 0 \}
$$
where $\ast_i, 1 \le i \le s \in \{<, >, =\}$. $S$ can be partitioned into a finite union of some of the $s^3$ sign sets. 
If we apply the smooth stratification algorithm to each $S_{(\ast_1,\ldots,\ast_s)} \subset S$, and take the union of strata, we will obtain a smooth stratification of the set $S$. Indeed, since no two sign sets have non-empty intersection, it is clear that no two strata intersect, and since a finite number of the sign-sets form a partition of $S$, the smooth strata of these sign-sets also forms a partition of $S$.
