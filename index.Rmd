# WHat to include

- Introduction

  - introduce the concepts and definitions
  - state what will be presented
  - and why it is important

- Existing work

  - @jdh20 (regular cells, no blow-ups)
  - @lazard10 (blow-ups in $R^3$)
  - McCallum (projection yields smooth cells)
  - Order invariant CAD

- @bgv15
  - Constructively proves the existence of a CAD with regular cells and satisfying the frontier condition in 3 steps
  - Such that each cell is the graph of a quasi-affine map
  - Refine such that each cell is monotone
  - Refine such that the boundary $\partial C$ of every cell
