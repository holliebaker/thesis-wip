# Cylindrical algebraic decompositions with monotone cells

A Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) is a finite partition of n-dimensional space into so-called Cylindrical Cells. The
key idea of cylindricity is that cells are arranged in *stacks*. I.e., the projection of any two cells onto dimension
n-1 is either disjoint or identical.

CAD provides a constructive and computationally tractable proof of the famous Tarski-Seidenberg theorem, which states thet semialgebraic sets are
closed under projection, or, equivalently, that quantifier elimination is possible over the reals. Indeed, QE is
possibly the most famous application of CAD. CAD also has applications in computing topological ploperties of
semialgebraic sets and solving motion-planninng problems. However, for these applications, a basic CAD will not suffice.
Instead, we may have to introduce some additional constraints to the construction. One such constraint, which is useful
in topology, is that every cell in the CAD is a *topologically regular cell*. Put briefly, its boundary should be
homeomorphic to a circle. Another useful property is the *frontier condition*. I.e., the boundary of every cell in the
decomposition must be a union of some other cells in the decomposition of smaller dimension. This property is necessary
to solve motion planning problems.

Tho goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm to construct a *monotone* CAD -- right now it's enough to know that
this is a CAD in which every cell is topologically regular and satisfies the frontier condition. The algorithm is based
on a construction due to [@bgv15].
