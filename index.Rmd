Algebraic geometry is a fundamental and active area of research in mathematics and, loosely speaking, is concerned with
studying sets which can be defined by polynomials. A fundamental object in algebraic geometry is the algebraic variety,
a set defined by the simultaneous solutions to a system of polynomial equations. Sometimes, a wider class of sets,
semialgebraic sets, which are defined by a Boolean combination of polynomial equations and inequalities, are studied. Complex algebraic geometry involves working over an algebraically closed field, where the fundamental theorem of algebra holds, while in real algebraic geometry we are restricted to the real numbers. The focus of this research is on algorithms for computing with semialgebraic sets defined over the real numbers.
Computational algebraic geometry spans both mathematics and computer science and involves developing algorithms for working with the fundamental objects of algebraic geometry, e.g., algebraic varieties, polynomial ideals and semialgebraic sets.
Some fundamental results in this area were presented at the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation which was held in Marseille in 1979 (now part of ISSAC).
@buchberger1979 presented his criterion and an algorithm for computing a Groebner basis for a polynomial ideal defined over a real closed field, which is still one of the most efficient methods for finding the complex solution of a systems of multivariate polynomial equations.
@lazard1979 also presented an algorithm, based on Macalay's multivariate resultants, for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations over any field (algebraically closed or otherwise), which has complexity singly exponential in the number of unknowns.
@arnon1979 described an extension to Collins' algorithm for computing cylindrical decompositions of real space, which allows one to determine the dimension of a semialgebraic set and deduce some of its topological properties.
Since then, there have been many advances in these areas, both in extending the applications of these algorithms and making them more efficient.

A fundamental result in real algebraic geometry is Tarski's Theorem [@vdd1988tarski], which states that semialgebraic sets are closed under projection.
This result is not true for algebraic sets, neither real nor complex. Indeed, consider the projection of the solutions of the polynomial $xy = 1$ onto the $x$-axis. We get $\R \setminus \{ 0 \}$, which is not an algebraic set, but could be represented if we are allowed to use inequalities. Thus, we will be working over the category of semialgebraic sets: sets of points defined by Boolean combinations of polynomial equations and inequalities.
Alfred Tarski first alluded, without proof, to his famous theorem in the abstract of @sierpinski1930. He then proved the
theorem in [@tarski1998] whose planned publication in 1939 was delayed due to the war. @seidenberg1954 published "A New
Decision Method for Elementary Algebra", which applies Tarski's theorem to quantifier elimination problems over real
closed fields, leading to the well-known Tarski--Seidenberg Theorem.
@lojasiewicz1964 gives a constructive proof of the Tarski--Seidenberg theorem using successive projections onto $n-1$-dimensional space. This is the idea behind the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) algorithm.
The notion and algorithm for computing a CAD was presented by @collins1975.
The algorithm partitions $\R^n$ into cylindrical cells -- semialgebraic sets such that the projection of any two of them is either disjoint or coincides.
Collins' algorithm is the first computationally tractable proof of the Tarski--Seidenberg theorem, the algorithm having complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables.
CAD has wide ranging applications in real algebraic geometry.
Perhaps the most famous application is the one Collins was thinking of -- quantifier elimination: given a Boolean formula where literals are polynomial equations and inequalities and some variables are bound by $\forall$ and $\exists$ quantifiers, return a Boolean formula without quantifiers representing the same set.
A similar problem uses CAD to decide whether a formula in which all variables are quantified is true or false -- the decision problem.
More recently, alternative methods for performing quantifier elimination have been proposed, e.g., the critical point method (see @safeldin2013).
Other notable uses include determining whether a semialgebraic set is empty, computing the real roots of a system of multivariate polynomials and determining the dimension of a semialgebraic set. @bpr98 employs the critical point method to the emptiness problem, obtaining a bound singly exponential in the number of variables and @koiran1999 proved that determining the dimension of a semialgebraic set is ${\mathrm{NP}}_{\R}$-complete, obtaining a singly exponential bound.
CAD can also be used to deduce topological properties of semialgebraic sets, for example by computing homologies.

> TO DO: maybe ask James about further applications of CAD.

The CAD algorithm is still an active and interesting area of study, with two main strands of research. Since the complexity of computing a CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables, the algorithm can be intractable for even moderately-sized problems. It is impossible to lower this theoretical bound. Indeed @davenportHeintz1988 prove that quantifier elimination by CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables.
They present an example of a first-order Boolean formula with quantifiers which requires a linear number of symbols while the formula obtained after quantifier elimination requires a doubly exponential number of symbols.
@brown07 later presented a simple and constructive proof of the same thing, giving an example of a formula with only one free variable and containing only linear polynomials whose quantifier-free counterpart is doubly exponential in length.

CAD depends on a fixed coordinate ordering and this can greatly influence the number of cells produced. In the same paper, @brown07 show that the same input may produce a linear number of cells for one ordering, but a doubly exponential number of cells for another. They also present an example for which every coordinate ordering yields a doubly exponential number of cells [@brown07].
In some applications, we may be able to change the coordinate ordering. As such, one way to "speed up" CAD construction would be to find a coordinate ordering which yields the smallest number of cells. @hong1993 was one of the first to do this, using best first search, a heuristic search technique in AI, to find an optimal ordering. More recent developments include @delrio2022, who used complexity analysis to improve upon the current state-of-the-art heuristics, obtaining benchmark results 17 times slower than the theoretical best, while the state-of-the-art performs 25 times slower than the theoretical best.
In addition, modern AI and machine learning techniques are being investigated as a means of finding the best coordinate ordering. For example, @huang2014 employed support vector machines and @chen2020 used artificial neural networks to identify an optimal ordering.
Both of these techniques outperformed classical heuristics, making this a promising application of AI and ML.

However, in many cases we cannot change the coordinate ordering and, even if we could, @brown07 showed that for some inputs all coordinate orderings yield a doubly exponential number of cells. As such, making optimisations in the CAD algorithm itself has been an active area of study since Collins published his original algorithm in the 70s. Collins' algorithm works on the principal of projection and lifting. First, successive projections of input polynomials are performed, until we obtain a set of polynomials in one variable. The roots of these polynomials are isolated and then "stacks" of cells above each root and each interval in between the roots are constructed. The CAD of $n$-dimensional space is obtained by iterating this process, called the "lifting phase".
Minimising the number of polynomials produced by the projection operation means fewer computations are needed during the lifting phase. @mccallum1998 proposed an improved projection operator, observing that some polynomials included in Collins' original projection operator can be removed. Many other projection operators, e.g., Hong's (see @hong1990) Lazard's projection (see @mccallum2019) have been proposed, each offering different properties. Another optimisation is to construct a "partial CAD", proposed by @collins1991. The idea is to use truth evaluation while constructing cells, taking quantifiers into account, so that only the cells we care about will be computed. As we do not have to ensure constant sign no every polynomial, this approach leads to savings during the lifting phase. The CAD algorithm has also been modified, often by weakening its properties, to solve specific problems. E.g., @mccallum1993 presents an algorithm, based on CAD, for deciding the consistency of a system of strict polynomial inequalities. These modifications often have much better complexity than the classical CAD, while producing sufficient decompositions to solve the problem at hand.

A different strand of research, which is the main focus of this thesis, is to compute cylindrical decompositions in which the cells have certain desirable properties. This contrasts with the optimisations previously discussed, as these CADs often contain more cells than those constructed using the classical algorithm. However, this trade-off is worthwhile because the additional conditions make the CADs more powerful.
Indeed, @pianomovers1983 apply cylindrical algebraic decomposition to a motion planning problem in which one wants to find a path, or prove that none exists, for a rigid (possibly hinged) body to move through a space defined by a configuration of walls. This has obvious applications in robotics. In order to solve this problem, cells are required to be arranged in a particular way: the closure of every cell must be a union of cells in the decomposition. Using classical CAD, this condition cannot always be satisfied, but @pianomovers1983 prove the classical algorithm is sufficient if a linear change of coordinates is made.
These CADs are also useful if we wish to compute topological properties of semialgebraic sets. For example, @reif1979 gives an algorithm for computing the homology groups of an arbitrary real algebraic variety. As we alluded to earlier, over the reals, a formula cannot tell us much about the set it defines, so this is useful for deducing properties of semialgebraic sets, e.g., how many "holes" it has, or whether it is connected.
Along similar lines, @arnon1984 present an algorithm to compute a CAD of the plane along with information about which cells "touch each other". They extend this result to 3-dimensional space in [@arnon1987]. In order to compute these cell adjacencies, we again need the property that the closure of every cell is a union of cells in the decomposition. @arnon1987 achieve this without making a change of coordinates.

Another desirable property is that every cell in a cylindrical decomposition is a topologically regular cell. Loosely speaking, this means that each $k$-dimensional cell and its closure is homeomorphic to a $k$-dimensional sphere and its closure.
This property can fail in the region of points where polynomials are not "well behaved".
E.g., points where a polynomial vanishes over an open interval (for the precise definition, see Definition
\@ref(def:blow-up-point)).
For example, consider the Whitney umbrella, the set of points in $\R^3$ which satisfy the equation $f = 0$ where
$$
f := x^2 - y^2 z.
$$
At almost every point $(x,y) \in \R^2$, $f$ is well-behaved. having only one value of $z$ at which it is equal to zero.
However, $f$ "blows up" above the origin, vanishing at every point. This causes interesting behaviour as $(x,y)$ approaches the origin, because the $z$-coordinate tends to infinity. Thus, the set
\begin{equation}
\{ 0 < x < 1, -1 < y < 1, x^2 - y^2 z = 0 \},
(\#eq:basic-semialgebraic-whit)
\end{equation}
which is a cylindrical cell in $\R^3$, is not topologically regular and its closure contains the half-line $\{ x = 0, y = 0, z \ge 0 \}$.
We will study CAD containing blow-up points and cells which are not topologically regular throughout this thesis.
@lazard10 presents an algorithm which produces such a decomposition, in the potential presence of these blow-up points, for dimension $\le 3$. This so-called "strong" cylindrical algebraic decomposition consists of only topologically regular cells and the closure of every cell is a union of some cells in the decomposition. @lazard10 takes an algebraic approach, employing techniques such as computing the saturation of a polynomial ideal, to make computations efficient and explains how the algorithm can be implemented in Maple.
Many inputs to the CAD algorithm do not contain blow-up points. @jhd20 prove that the classical CAD algorithm will produce a strong decomposition for the given coordinate ordering and regardless of the method used to compute it. This is a very useful result as it allows us to take advantage of the nice properties of strong decompositions without doing any extra work to obtain them.
However, sometimes blow-up points are unavoidable. For example, @bgv15 propose an algorithm for computing a triangulation of a definable monotone family which relies on a strong cylindrical decomposition of that family. Since these families depend on a fixed coordinate ordering and frequently contain blow-up points, we must be able to compute these strong decompositions in arbitrary dimension, in the potential presence of blow-ups and without having to make a change of coordinates.

Note that, in Equation \@ref(eq:basic-semialgebraic-whit), we write a basic semialgebraic set of the form
$$
\{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \land \ldots \land f_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \land g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \land \ldots \land g_\ell(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}
$$
as
$$
\{ f_1(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \ldots, f_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0, g_1(\mathbf{x}) > 0, \ldots, g_\ell(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \}.
$$
I.e., commas represent conjunction. When not ambiguous, this convention will be used throughout.

@bgv15 present a constructive proof that, given a family $V := (V_1,\ldots,V_k)$ of bounded definable sets in $\R^n$ such that $\dim(V_i) \le 2$ for all $1 \le i \le k$, there exists a cylindrical decomposition in which each $V_i, 1 \le i \le k$ is a union of cells, such that every cell contained in $V_i$ is monotone and its closure is the union of cells in the decomposition. A monotone cell is a stronger property than topological regularity and, by @bgv13 Theorem 1, all monotone cells are topologically regular. Their proof explains how such a decomposition can be constructed and depends on classical CAD and simple tools such as refinements by linear equations and splitting two-dimensional cells  by using a given curve interval.
The main goal of this thesis will be to design and implement an algorithm, based on this result, for constructing such a decomposition in the semialgebraic case.
The constructive proof works for more general definable sets and, in contrast to e.g. @collins1975 or @lazard10, is geometric in nature. As such, the properties we need to satisfy in order to complete the construction are described in detail but not the methods used to obtain them. For example, we are asked to consider critical points of the smooth 2-dimensional locus of a union of definable sets, or consider the boundary of a 2-dimensional cylindrical cell.
We will use a combination of fundamental tools in differential geometry, e.g., partial derivatives and Jacobi determinants, well-known algorithms in algebraic geometry such as smooth stratification and quantifier elimination, and ideas from optimisation, such as Lagrange multipliers.

A similar idea to that presented by @bgv15 is discussed by @vdd1998 (Section 2.19), who introduces the concept of a Van-den-Dries regular cell.

::: {.definition}
[@vdd1998, Section 2.19]
We say that a cylindrical cell $C \subset \R^n$ is Van-den-Dries regular if, for all $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, if two distinct points $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y} \in C$ are such that $x_1 = y_1, \ldots, x_{i-1} = y_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n = y_n$, but $x_i < y_i$, then for all $z_i$ such that $x_i < z_i < y_i$, $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1},z_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n) \in C$.
:::

All two-dimensional Van-den-Dries regular cells are topologically regular, so if $\dim(V_1,\ldots,V_k)$, the
decomposition described by @vdd1998 will consist of topologically regular cells. The result of @bgv15 is stronger in that the monotone decomposition is obtained for a family of sets which individually have dimension at most two.

Part of the result from @bgv15 will be generalised to sets of arbitrary dimension. In particular, a novel algorithm for constructing a cylindrical decomposition, compatible with a semialgebraic set and suc that the boundary of every cell is the union of cells in the decomposition, will be presented. (This work was presented, in extended abstract form, at ISSAC 2023 and has also been submitted to the Journal of Symbolic computation.)
It will be proved that such a decomposition can be constructed in any dimension and without a preliminary change of coordinates even in the presence of blow-ups. A CAD is compatible with a set $S$ if $S$ is the union of some cells of the CAD. Frontier condition means that the closure of every cell is a union of some cells in the decomposition.
To our knowledge, this is the first proof that such a CAD exists without the change of coordinates.
We present the proof in the form of an algorithm which constructs a CAD compatible with a semialgebraic set $S \subset \R^n$ and satisfying the frontier condition.
An upper bound on complexity is obtained. This is also an upper bound on the number of cells, number of polynomials and degree of polynomials in the CAD. The algorithm has *elementary* complexity (in the sense of L. Kalmar, see e.g.,
[@kleene1952, $\S 57$]). This means that the complexity can be expressed as a power tower of finite height.

The frontier condition is useful in computing topological properties of semialgebraic sets defined by first-order Boolean formulas. For example, these decompositions can be viewed as closure-finite weak cell complexes (CW-complexes) and their homologies can be computed. In addition, cell adjacencies can easily be computed and motion-planning problems, for instance the well-known "piano-mover's problem" presented by Schwartz and Sharir can be solved, leading to applications in robotics.

It was shown by @pianomovers1983 that it is relatively easy to satisfy the frontier condition after a generic linear rotation of coordinates in $\R^n$. The rotation removes the need to lift over blow-up points. However, such a rotation of coordinates may be undesirable, or even impossible, in some applications.

An important application relates to the work of @bgv15, who present an algorithm for computing the triangulation of a definable monotone family. This algorithm requires a CAD of the family such that every cell is topologically regular and satisfies the frontier condition. Since the definable monotone family depends on the initial coordinate ordering, a rotation of coordinates is not allowed. @jhd20 prove that if a CAD is *well-based* then it satisfies these properties.
A CAD is well-based if it contains no *bad cells*: cells above which one of the polynomials defining the CAD vanishes identically. These occur frequently in definable monotone families. Therefore, an algorithm for computing CAD with frontier condition, compatible with sets containing blow-ups and without a change of coordinates, is needed. Such a CAD algorithm is presented by the authors for sets of dimension not greater than two. [@bgv15] The algorithm presented in this paper provides a step towards extending their result to decompositions compatible with sets (and potentially triangulations of definable monotone families) of arbitrary dimension.

In addition, the result can be applied to other categories, e.g., semialgebraic sets defined by *fewnomials* (see Section \@ref{sec:pfaffian)), whose structure is destroyed by a change of coordinates.

The result can also be easily extended to semialgebraic sets defined by first-order Boolean formulas with quantifiers.
Indeed, by Theorem \@ref{thm:proj}, the projection of a CAD with frontier condition to any dimension also satisfies the frontier condition, and quantifier elimination requires considering projections of the CAD.

@arnon1984 also made important developments in constructing cylindrical algebraic decompositions with frontier condition. They propose an algorithm for constructing a ``proper'' CAD of $\R^2$, a similar notion to the *well-based* CAD. Their algorithm also computes the cell adjacencies for this CAD.
The same authors extend this result to proper CADs of $\R^3$, along with computing cell adjacencies.[@arnon1987]
@lazard10 also presents an algorithm for obtaining a CAD in $\R^n$ for $n \le 3$ satisfying the frontier condition without a change of coordinates. Lazard takes an algebraic approach and the complexity of the algorithm presented is the same as that of classical CAD, while our construction uses a recursion on the lexicographical order of cell indices. A novel approach was needed because it is not clear how the above results could be extended to dimension greater than $3$.

Finally, we will also describe an algorithm for computing a smooth stratification of a semialgebraic set. A smooth stratification is a finite partition of a set into smooth manifolds called "strata". We present an algorithm, based on the work of @gv1995 for computing a smooth stratification of a semialgebraic set such that each stratum is nicely defined, meaning that each stratum of codimension $k$ is defined by $k$ different polynomials.
The algorithm is designed to handle input sets which are not nicely defined. E.g., sets defined by polynomials whose first partial derivatives vanish at every point in the set.
For example, the algebraic set
$$
S := \{ x y = 0 \}
$$
has codimension one, and thus can be defined by a single polynomial. However, it is not smooth, since $S' = (0,0)$ is a singular point of $S$. $S'$ has codimension $2$ and it is clear that it can be written using two polynomials
$$
S' = \{ x = 0, y = 0 \}.
$$
Observe that $x$ and $y$ are the first derivatives of the defining function $xy$. However,
$$
\{ x^m y^n = 0, m \ge 1, n \ge 1 \}
$$
defines the set $S$ and, if $m > 1$,
$$
\dfrac{\partial x^m y^n}{\partial x} = m x^{m-1} y^n
$$
is equal to zero at the same points as $x^my^n$. Thus, it may not be sufficient to find the points at which only the first derivatives vanish. This is the basic idea of the smooth stratification algorithm we will present.
The algorithm also ensures that only the $k$ functions required to define a stratum of codimension $k$ are included, "pruning" functions which do not add any additional information.

> TO DO: applications of the smooth stratification?

## Structure of this thesis

Chapter \@ref(sec:background) gives some necessary definitions, then presents some useful results from @bgv15. The CAD
is then formally defined, and the flow of the algorithm, following the description given by @coste2000 is outlined.
Chapter \@ref(sec:smooth-strat) presents the smooth stratification algorithm from @gv1995, Theorem 2.
The construction is made concrete, leading to an algorithm, presented as psuedo-code, for the semialgebraic case. This algorithm has been implemented in C on top of SACLIB. Saclib is an open-source C/C++ library for manipulating real polynomials and real algebraic numbers and working with their solutions as real algebraic numbers (see @saclib).
The following is proved, the main contribution being the complexity result for the semialgebraic case.

::: {.theorem #strat }
Let
$$
X := \{ \mathbf{x} \in \R^n \mid f_1 = 0, \ldots, f_k = 0, g_1 > 0, \ldots, g_\ell > 0 \},
$$
be a semialgebraic set defined by $s = k + \ell$ different polynomials of maximum degree $d$.
Then there is an algorithm, without oracle, which partitions $X$ into a family
$$
{\cal X} = (X_0, \ldots, X_n)
$$
such that, if $X$ is nonsingular, $X_0 = X$ and all other sets are empty.
Otherwise, $X_0 = \emptyset$ and each $X_k, 1 \le k \le n$ is a possibly empty, effectively nonsingular stratum of codimension $k$.
This algorithm has complexity
$$
3^{s}\left(s(d+1)\right)^{O(n)^{2}}.
$$
The number of strata does not exceed $s^{n} (d + 1)^2$, and each stratum is defined by at most $s (d + 1)^2$ polynomial equations and inequalities of maximum degree $(d + 1)^2$.

Chapters \@ref(sec:quasi-affine), \@ref(sec:monotone-cells) and \@ref(sec:frontier-bgv) concern the construction from

The main contribution is an algorithm for constructing the cylindrical decomposition described in @bgv15, Theorem 3.20, for the semialgebraic case.

::: { .theorem #bgv-algorithm }

Informally, an algorithm, which takes family of quantifier-free Boolean formulas representing some semialgebraic sets of dimension at most two as input and produces a cylindrical decomposition in which each of the input sets is a union of its cells.
This decomposition has the property that each cylindrical cell contained in one of the input sets is *monotone* (see Definition \@ref(def:monotone-cell)) and its closure is a union of cells in the decomposition. A complexity bound, only slightly higher than the "classical" CAD is obtained.

This algorithm follows the construction given in the proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20, which proceeds in three stages.
First, a cylindrical cell decomposition of $\R^n$, compatible with each $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ and such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ is the graph of a quasi-affine map. In Chapter \@ref(sec:quasi-affine), an algorithm, following @bgv15, Lemma 3.19 is presented for the semialgebraic case. The following is proved.

::: { .theorem #bgv-quasi-algorithm }

Then there is an algorithm, taking $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ as input, which constructs an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD $\mathcal{D}$ of $\R^n$, which is obviously compatible with each $V_1,\ldots,V_k$, such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup \ldots\cup V_k$ is a smooth manifold and the graph of a quasi-affine map.
This algorithm has complexity
$$

which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.
:::

Chapter 5 discusses, following the proofs of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20 and Theorem 3.18, how the CAD $\mathcal{D}$ produced by the algorithm from Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-quasi-algorithm) can be refined such that cells in the refinement are monotone with respect to each $V_1,\ldots,V_k$. An algorithm for constructing this refinement, starting with the polynomials which have constant sign on cells of $\mathcal{D}$, is presented.

Finally, Chapter \@ref(sec:frontier) describes how to complete the construction described in @bgv15, Theorem 3.20, by refining the CAD such that it satisfies the frontier condition. Section \@ref(sec:frontier-bgv) describes how the construction given in the last part of the proof of @bgv15, Theorem 3.20 can be applied to the CAD $\mathcal{D'}$, produced by the algorithm from Theorem \@ref(thm:bgv-monotone-algorithm) to produce a refinement $\mathcal{D''}$ of $\mathcal{D'}$ such that the closure of every cell of $\mathcal{D'}$ contained in $V_1\cup \ldots \cup V_k$ is the union of some cells of $\mathcal{D''}$.
In Section \@ref(sec:lazard-3), an algorithm, due to @lazard10, for constructing an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n, n \le 3$ satisfying the frontier condition and containing only topologically regular cells is presented. Section \@ref(sec:lazard-n) explores how this method can be generalised to our situation. In order to do this, the results of @lazard10, Section 5.3 are generalised from $\R^3$ to the two-dimensional cells in a CAD of $\R^n, n > 3$.
The following is proved.

::: { .theorem #lazard-rn }
Let $\mathbf{F} \subset \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a set of $s$ polynomials with maximum degree $d$.
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\mathbf{F}$-invariant CAD of $\R^n$, monotone with respect to each bounded semialgebraic set $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ ($\dim(V_i) \le 2 1\le i \le k$).

Then there is an algorithm, taking $\mathcal{D}$ as input, which produces a refinement $\mathcal{D'}$ of $\mathcal{D}$ such that each cell $C \subset V_1\cup\ldots\cup V_k$ of $\mathcal{D'}$ satisfies the frontier condition.
This algorithm has complexity...
$$
\left(s\left(d+1\right)\right)^{O(1)^n},
$$
which is also an upper bound on the number of cells in the CAD, number of polynomials and their degrees.

All of these algorithms are presented as psuedo-code. Chapter \@ref(sec:implementation-and-testing) discusses the implementation of this algorithm on top of Brown's QEPCAD [@brownQepcad] and presents some test cases.

The final contribution, in Chapter \@ref(sec:novel-frontier), is a novel algorithm for constructing a CAD of $\R^n$, compatible with a semialgebraic set of arbitrary dimansion and satisfying the frontier condition. This algorithm relies on a recursion on the lexicographical order of indices $(i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in \{ 0,1 \}^n$ associated with each cell in a cylindrical decomposition. The following is proved.

::: {.theorem #main}
Let $S \subset \R^n$ be a semialgebraic set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula $F$ with $s$ different polynomials of maximum degree $d$ in $\R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
There is an algorithm, taking $F$ as input, which outputs a cylindrical decomposition $\mathcal D$ of $\R^n$ compatible with $S$ and
satisfying the frontier condition.
The complexity of this algorithm is $(sd)^{O(1)^{n2^n}}$.
This is also an upper bound on the number of cells in $\mathcal D$, number of polynomials defining cells and their degrees.

Finally, Chapter \@ref(sec:conclusions) discusses conclusions and further work.
